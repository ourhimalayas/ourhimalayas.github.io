8/19/2022  Miles Guo’s GETTR: The enterprises in Communist China only serve the ruling and privileged class of the CCP.  These business owners and the privileged class have not made any contribution to their society and country, and have not produced a single penny of wealth, yet they are allowed to be born rich. The NFSC people are determined to overturn all this and to strive hard for a democratic, free and just nation for all Chinese people.

8/19/2022  文贵盖特：中共国的企业都是为中共的权贵阶层服务，这些企业主和权贵们对社会和国家没有做出一丝贡献，不创造一分财富，却生下来就能享受荣华富贵。新中国联邦人就是要打破这一切，为全体中国人努力奋斗，建立一个民主、自由、平等的国度。
