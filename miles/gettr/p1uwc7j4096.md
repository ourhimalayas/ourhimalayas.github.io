2022.10.20 The Chinese Communist Party has spent a long time bribing the media in New York into smearing the Whistleblower Movement and the New Federal State of China. The New Yorker is covering up for the Chinese Communist Party, and many of its viewpoints are dangerous for such degeneration of a heritage media endangers humanity.
（无LOGO版）共产党这次谋划很久，花了大钱收买纽约时报，对爆料革命新中国联邦进行了负面的虚假报导。纽约时报帮共产党擦屁股，文章内很多观点都是很危险的，一个权威媒体这种堕落的表现，会让人类失去安全。
