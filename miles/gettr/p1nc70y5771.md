8/17/2022 Miles Guo: Educators in Communist China have harbored the descendants of the top CCP officials, allowing them to build their lavish lives on top of the blood and lives of the Chinese people. The CCP officially admits that 600 million Chinese are still living below the poverty line, while the CCP's kleptocrats have plundered enormous wealth via the collusion between the CCP officials and business owners, and they have even turned live organ harvesting into recreational consumption. It's not the time to expose the CCP's navy; God forbid if the CCP is not taken down!

8/17/2022 文贵直播：教育工作者庇护了中共高官的子孙们，让其奢侈生活建立在老百姓的鲜血和生命之上；中共官方承认有6亿人还生活在贫困线以下，而中共盗国贼却官商勾结攫取了巨额财富，甚至把换器官当成娱乐性消费；现在还不是爆海军的时候；中共不灭，天理不容!
