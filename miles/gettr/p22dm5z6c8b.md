【AMFEST 2022】12/19/2022 Dean Weitenhagen, a real state broker from Phoenix said he got to know Miles Guo about two years ago, since then, he has become a big fan of Miles Guo, and has been supporting his mission of taking down the CCP. Dean told us that the CCP just bought a soybean processing plant close to an airforce base for the purpose of spying on the military base. As for those American laywers who help and work for the CCP, Dean thinks he has no use for them.

【凤凰城涅槃行动】12/19/2022  来自凤凰城的地产商迪安∙韦滕哈根说他两年前就认识了郭先生并成为粉丝，一直支持郭先生的灭共事业。他还说，中共购买美国一空军基地附近的大豆加工厂就是为了监视美军基地。在他眼里，那些帮助中共的律师一文不值。
