2022.08.27 From the feedback of my friends and fellow fighters, Miles found that the number of deaths in the world has increased significantly. We are also witnessing frequent natural disasters, such as global drought, which will inevitably lead to global food shortages. Most people dare to talk about these disasters, but very few dare to face the vaccine deaths and vaccine disasters that are more terrifying than the Holocaust. Miles would just like to ask everyone: are these disasters not a result of greed, selfishness, and tolerance of the CCP's genocide in China?

文贵从朋友和战友的反馈中，发现最近全世界死亡人数大增；大家也看到了各种恶性自然灾害频发，比如全球大旱，必然导致的全球粮荒。大多数人只敢谈这些表面的灾难，却少有人敢直面比大屠杀还恐怖的疫苗致死和疫苗灾难。文贵想问大家：这些灾难难道不是世人以前的贪婪，自私，放纵共匪在中国各地大屠杀导致的轮回报应吗？
