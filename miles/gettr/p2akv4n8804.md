【NFSC @CPAC 】03/04/2023 Author Daniel Brubaker: I am concerned that things like this would have been a test run of, you know, for possible future activities. The people who sent those balloons understand how we would react in a situation like that, which is information that's very valuable to them. And we should be very careful and attentive to how we act on these sorts of things.
