2022.11.04  A Tibetan friend of mine told me, on his way back from running errands for the temple, he stepped on several decomposed bodies.  Xi Jinping and the CCP are prepared to lose half of the population for their rise to world dominance. The CCP cares nothing about human rights nor what the western press says about them. Darkness is upon us, and few realize this. There is no peace for the world and safety for humanity when CCP remains.
（无LOGO版）我们西藏一个朋友说，出寺庙办事回来路上，踩到了好几个腐烂的尸体。习太阳和共产党是做好中国人死掉一半的准备，他要在世界当老大，共产党不会考虑CNN和福克斯讲的人权人道。黑暗已经到来，醒来的人太少了，共产党不灭，世界和人类都将没有一天安宁的日子。
