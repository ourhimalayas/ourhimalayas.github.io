2022.09.13 爆料革命绝不掺和美国两党政治。两党在美国利益上是高度统一的，而中共国14亿人却只被几个家族控制，还要彼此争斗。中共及其走狗没有道德，没有信仰，没有一个人有安全感。
9/12/2022 Miles Guo: The Whistleblower Movement would never interfere in American bipartisan politics. The two parties are highly united when it comes to the interests of the US whereas in China, 1.4 billion people are controlled by just a few families which fight with each other. The CCP and their stooges have no morals, no religion, and none of them feels secure.
