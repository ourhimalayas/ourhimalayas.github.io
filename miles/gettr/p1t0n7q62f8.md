2022.10.03 To what extent that Khamenei can control Iran? Probably every single grass may be controlled by Khamenei and his family. After the government of Ruhollah Khomeini, Khamenei has controlled the political party, the government, the legal system, business including the exports of oil and gas, are all controlled by Khamenei's family. In Khamenei's life, he kills every single person that may threaten him.
（无LOGO版）哈梅内伊对伊朗的控制到什么程度？寸草可以说都过不了哈梅内伊的家族。伊朗在整个霍梅尼之后，哈梅内伊把整个党权，政权、政法权，特别是生意，出口油和气，全在他一家人控制了。但是在生活中的他，绝不放过一个对他威胁的人。
