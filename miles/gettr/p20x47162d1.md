2022.12.06 尊敬的战友们好，我，郭文贵在此向全世界的战友和新中国联邦所有成员悲痛告知：我的父亲于北京时间2022年12月6日晚9点57分无疾而逝，享年93岁。从即日起，我将按照山东老家和中国人的传统历史文化宗教的习俗：三周内闭门守孝为父亲祈福，望全球的新中国联邦的同仁们、战友们都能更爱自己的父亲、母亲、岳父、岳母和家人，失去的永远不会再回来….七哥最想和你们分享的就是爱你们的家人，珍惜生命，此时此刻我们更牢记永远不要忘了我们的使命，消灭这个地球上最邪恶的中国共产党！！！（三周内七哥不会有任何的视频和直播，在此向战友们汇报：期间七哥将不受限制的抽雪茄）

Dear Supporters of The New Federal State of China,

I, Miles Guo, announce with great sorrow the passing of my beloved father at 9:57 PM BJT on Dec. 6th, 2022. He was 93 years old and passed away peacefully with no illness.Effective immediately, I will follow the cultural and religious traditions of my hometown in Shandong, China, and begin a three-week mourning period in loving memory of my father.

To the NFSC's supporters worldwide, it is my sincere wish that every one of you will learn to better love and cherish your father, mother, father-in-law, mother-in-law, and extended families while you can. Because those whom you have lost will never come back.

The most important message I want to convey is that I hope you love your family and cherish life! However, it is more important now than ever before to remember our mission: taking down the Chinese Communist Party! 

(Despite my public vow to limit the number of cigars I smoke each year, I want to let our supporters know that this limitation will not apply during the three-week mourning period. I will also not be posting any videos or hosting any livestreams during this time.)
