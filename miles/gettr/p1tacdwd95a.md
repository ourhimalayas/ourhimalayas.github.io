10/5/2022 Miles Guo: Back then, a delegation led by the head of their country flew to Beijing to meet 11 people including Meng Jianzhu and Sun Lijun. Meng told them in person that Miles Guo was not and had never been a CCP member and a CCP spy. The delegation and the head of the country were all shocked after hearing Meng’s words. They rejected Meng’s request of asking them to assist in repatriating me, in addition, they explicitly stated that they would protect me as their brother.

10/5/2022  文贵直播：当年某国元首率代表团到北京会见孟建柱和孙力军等11人，孟亲自向他们证实了文贵不是共产党员，也不是中共的特务。代表团和这位元首听完孟的话都很震惊，当时就拒绝了孟提出的各种遣返我的要求，并明确告诉中共，他们会像保护兄弟一样保护文贵。
