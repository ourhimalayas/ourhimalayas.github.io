【NFSC @CPAC 】03/02/2023 Senior Investigative Reporter Joshua Philipp: The Chinese Communist Party is a gangster regime. The United States needs to understand that we are at war with the CCP. It's undeclared while the CCP declared it. But we don’t realize it. Seize the means of production is one of the main ideas of communism. We must ban the CCP from buying farmland, and natural resources etc before it’s too late. Apart from unrestricted warfare, CCP also has three warfare concepts: psychological warfare, media warfare and legal warfare. 

【新中国联邦DC星火行动】03/02/2023 资深调查记者约书亚‧菲利普：中共就是一个黑帮政权。美国需要认识到我们正与中共交战，中共已经不宣而战了，但我们却没有意识到这一点。共产主义的核心思想之一是掌控生产资料，我们必须禁止中共购买农地、自然资源等等，否则为时已晚。除了超限战，中共还有三种战争策略，它们是心理战、舆论战和法律战。
