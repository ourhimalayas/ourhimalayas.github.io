2022.09.29 On Sep. 29th, 2022, Mr. Miles Guo first broke the news of the imminent death of Ayatollah Khomeini in the world. After the failure of undergoing his heart surgery, Khomeini’s medical team decided that Khamenei's heart was not likely to recover and had a 99% chance of death within the next 48 hours. Khamenei's demise will destroy the Xi-Pu-Ha iron triangle. With his demise, the Iranian people will truly move toward the democracy they aspire to. God is providing peace to the Strait of Hormuz, and all Middle East countries. Khamenei's demise can also completely set free the UAE, Kuwait, and entire neighboring countries of Iran from its shadows. The demise of his twisted view of the Curran will bring the world back to all Muslims.
