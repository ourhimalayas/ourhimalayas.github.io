02/16/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 89: Our continuous protests have gained support from a former mayor of a small town in Upstate New York. He is a young, rising political star who cares much about American society and hopes to have more discussions with us. He read lots of news about the NFSC and knew about our Whistleblowers’ Movement. Our protests have gained so much support from all walks of life in America.
