1/18/2023 Miles Guo: An American who just visited Foxconn Zhengzhou describes Communist China as a hell full of selfishness, apathy and despair; an American financial tycoon was arranged by Kissinger to meet with Xi Jinping in Beijing. However, a few hours before meeting, he was notified that the meeting was canceled due to the virus and Xi’s safety concerns; the entire Communist China is shrouded in extreme fear!
