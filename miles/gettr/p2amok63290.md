【NFSC @CPAC 】03/03/2023 Rachel's interview with former Bush administration official Manuel A. Rosales: To stop the Chinese Communist Party's aggression against the U.S, the U.S. should elect the right governing officials to take a tough stance against the Chinese CCP, and continue to impose trade sanctions on them. In addition, the U.S. people need to be a little more diligent to reduce their dependence on the CCP, especially for food and pharmaceutical supplies.

【新中国联邦DC星火行动】03/03/2023 瑞秋采访前布什政府官员曼努埃尔·罗萨莱斯：阻止中共对美国的攻击，美国应该选对执政官员，对中共采取强硬态度，并继续对中共施加贸易制裁。此外，美国人应该更勤奋一点，以减少对中共国的依赖，尤其是食品和药品供应。
