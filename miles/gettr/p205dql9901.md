11/29/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Fellow fighters of the Whistleblowers’ Movement are at the frontline of the anti-lockdown protests in Communist China, risking the lives of their own and family members. As long as Chinese people rise up against the CCP and persist for 72 hours, the CCP would fall faster than Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi. It is said that “Xi the Sun” has been very sick lately! #antilockdwonProtest #XiJinping

11/29/2022 文贵盖特：爆料革命的战友们冒着自己和家人的生命危险走在反隔离清零抗争的最前线，中国人只要站起来反抗并坚持72小时，共产党会倒得比萨达姆、卡扎菲还快。据说习太阳最近身体很不好！
