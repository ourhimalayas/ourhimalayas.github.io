【NFSC @CPAC 】03/02/2023 Director of Outreach at Moms for Liberty Cataline Stubbe: We have to be concerned, we have to be strong and courageous, this is a fight that we have to win. We need to protect and defend and promote American value at all cost, because American value is the cornerstone of this civilization.
We are the only ones who decide for our children, not a politician who doesn't even have children.
