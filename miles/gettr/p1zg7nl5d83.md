💥Neil Torpey, a partner of Paul Hastings who also serves as the chair of Paul Hastings Hong Kong office was confronted by NFSC protestors this morning. He said he doesn’t represent the CCP.
💥How can he not represent CCP when his office oversees multibillion dollar deals from CCP and recruited CCP spies to work for him?
💥Yan Jia and Vivian Lam from Paul Hastings HK office are direct recruits from CCP. Neil Torpey is 100% owned and paid for by CCP! Neil Torpey is a 100% CCP running dog  🐩 🐕 🐶
