President Biden declared the pandemic is over because he has no other choices. People have to live with the illness for a long time, to get along with it and to coexist with it. The long-term closed-door policy is like the pandemic quarantine and isolation of the CCP. This will inevitably lead to collapse of social supply chain and the cooperative life styles. In this case，your only option is to ease the restrictions. But what the CCP manipulates is to turn the whole disease into ways to govern the ordinary people, to politically dominate, to plunder wealth, to cover up social contradictions, to successfully hold the 20th National Congress of the CCP and to be a king continually.
（无LOGO版）拜登总统宣布新冠疫情大流行结束，人要长期与病为伍，与病相处，与病共生。长期的疫情限制政策必然最后导致社会的供应链与合作式生存方式的崩裂。
