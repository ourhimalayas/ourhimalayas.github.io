12/12/202 SAY NO TO EVIL, NFSC fellow fighters continue to protest against CCP and its accomplice, Paul Hastings at Roppongi, Tokyo, Japan. There are Chinese Communist collaborators like Luc in Japan as well. The CCP uses these people to influence Japan's national policy. The evil claws of the CCP have reached our feet.

12/12/202对邪恶说不，新中国联邦战友继续在日本东京抗议中共和它的帮凶普衡。战友们揭露在日本同样也有类似卢克的中共勾兑者，中共利用这些人来影响日本的国策。中共的魔爪其实早已经伸到了我们的脚下。
