2022.08.26 Xi’s anti-corruption campaign has backfired and turned to be an anti-Xi campaign. It is common knowledge that Xi has no say in any of these. All the officials who are under investigation while the anti-corruption campaign is hijacked, you are just the casualties that they throw out. If you are not waking up to this, you will only have yourself to blame

反腐反腐，最后把腐给反了。根本没有人站在习家这边。所有这些过程当中下马的官员都是被人家抛出来的牺牲品。如果你还不醒来，那就是你活该。
