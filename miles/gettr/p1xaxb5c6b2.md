11/6/2022 Miles Guo: Zeng Qinghong, Wang Yang, and Han Zheng would never do what Xi did if any of them came to power; the corpses of those who committed suicide by jumping off the buildings under the quarantine were carried away in garbage trucks or wheelbarrows without any dignity; history is always strikingly similar, and the chaos we face today is just like what happened in the Qing Dynasty. People today are more faithless than those in the Qing Dynasty!

11/6/2022 文贵直播：曾庆红、汪洋和韩正任何人上台都不会像习这样干；封控下跳楼自杀的死者毫无尊严地被垃圾车或手推车运走。历史总是惊人地相似，我们今天面临的乱象宛如大清朝，今天的人们比大清朝时的人还没有信仰！
