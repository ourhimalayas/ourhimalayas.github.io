2022.12.05 Xi Jinping claims that zero COVID isolation is the highest political wisdom of the CCP in its struggle with the world and the West, and it is the most effective way to deal with US imperialism.  The CCP will use a much lower death cost in China than the West and the whole world, and then break the Western supply chains, mess up the entire oil market, energy market, and commodity market, and take the opportunity to launch another attack on the West and Taiwan.
习近平号称清零隔离是中共对世界与西方的一场缠斗之中的最高政治智慧，是对待美帝国主义最有效之办法。中共和西方及全世界拼死亡成本，然后打破西方供应链，把整个石油市场、能源市场、大宗贸易市场全部搞乱，趁机对西方和台湾再发动袭击。
