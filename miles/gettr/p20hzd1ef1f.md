11/30/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP is very superstitious in believing in the saying that “China will benefit from five stars rising from the east”; according to Chinese five elements, the CCP belongs to “wood” and will be destroyed by fire; with the “fire dragon” of Pangu Plaza, the “fiery Buddha’s hands” of Yuda Plaza Hotel and the peak of “God of fire” in the Kunlun Mountains, the CCP is destined to be burned down by fire! #CCP #Pangu #Yuda #fire

11/30/2022 文贵直播：中共非常迷信"五星出东方利中华”这种说法；按照五行共产党属木，将毁于火，盘古的火龙和裕达的火佛手以及与其遥遥相对的昆仑神峰都注定中共会被火烧死！
