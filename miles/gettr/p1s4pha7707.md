9/25/2022 Miles Guo: The devaluation of the fiat currencies of various countries will accelerate the development of digital currencies around the world. Although the US dollar is the only one that remains strong, it is not good for itself, and the world economy will be worse off in the future! The abolition of the treatment of Communist China as a developing country means the beginning of the world's decoupling from the CCP. Europe will eventually decouple from the CCP even though it will take some time to do so. The next 6 months will be the critical period for Europe to determine its actions to decouple from the CCP.
