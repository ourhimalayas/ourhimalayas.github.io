12/30/2022 文贵盖特: 中共国的经济已到了无法挽救的地步，人民币的崩塌是和中共灭亡及其擀面杖经济有关。现在出现的街头烧尸体以及人被冻死、饿死在大街上的各种惨状正在验证这我这些年所说的话，我真希望现实证明我是错的

12/30/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The economy of Communist China has gone into an unrestorable situation. The collapse of the RMB is associated with the CCP’s demise and its false economic prosperity. The terrible scenes we’ve seen these days that people were cremated on the streets or died outside due to freezing or hunger are all verifying what I’ve said these years, and I really wish the reality proved me wrong.
