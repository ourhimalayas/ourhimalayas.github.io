2022.11.30 The number of people who downloaded Gettr in China yesterday was comparable to the number in the past few months. The Chinese Communist Party discussed and was going to open up the “Zero Covid Policy” and then arrest those who take the lead in resisting.
昨天一天国内下载盖特的人与过去几个月的数量相当，共产党讨论准备对清零隔离放松，然后对那些站出来反抗的人们进行抓捕。
