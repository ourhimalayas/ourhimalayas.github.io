2022.08.28 After Xi came to power, he joined forces with Wang Qishan to eliminate dissidents in the name of " anti-corruption and uphold integrity" , and arrested many people including Miles' family members and employees. (Wang) Qishan has repeatedly stated that the arrests were made on Xi's orders.

习上台后，联手王岐山借“反腐倡廉”之名，排除异己，抓了很多人也包括7哥的家人和员工，岐山多次声明抓人是奉了习的旨意。
