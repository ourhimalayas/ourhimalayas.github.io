1/31/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 73: At the protest site near the house of Luc Despins’ ex-wife, a policeman who was patrolling in the car gave thumbs up to our fellow fighters again and again and said, “Good job”; other policemen also said to us, “You are saving America. You are fighting for us. Thank you so much!”
