02/14/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL, fellow fighters from Japan continue to protest in front of Paul Hastings office building at Tokyo. Tomato briefly Summarizes the current situation in the U.S. for eliminating CCP. On Capitol Hill, NFSC fellow fighters are holding national flags in protest of the DOJ and SEC colluding with the CCP to use U.S. law as weapons to attack NFSC members who seek justice and the destruction of the CCP. NFSC has handed over the evidence of persecution to the U.S. Congressmen. We believe that the black hands behind the DOJ and SEC will be caught.
#SEC #DOJ #colludingwithccp
02/14/2023向邪恶说不，日本战友继续在东京普衡办公楼前抗议。番茄哥简述当前美国灭共新形势。新中国联邦战友举着国旗在美国国会山抗议美国司法部、证监会与中共勾结，把美国法律作为武器攻击追求正义，消灭中共的新中国联邦人。我们已经将迫害证据交到了美国议员的手里。相信DOJ和SEC背后的黑手一定会被抓出来。
 #SEC #DOJ #勾结中共
