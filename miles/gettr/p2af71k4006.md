【NFSC @CPAC 】03/02/2023 Rachel interviews high school student Bode Brewer: It's not racist to condemn and criticize what the Chinese Communist Party is doing. What they are doing is very wrong. It is oppressive, full of control, and based on hate. As Americans, we have to raise awareness. We will fight it to the end and stop what they are doing.
