2022.09.14 he domestic economy (in China) has reached the last squeeze prior to its collapse. Many countries have abandoned their vaccine (Covid-19) policies. There has been massive over-issuance of currency in the last two or three years, broken supply chain, and the resulting inflation. Don’t covet small profits at the last minute!

国内经济到了崩溃前的压榨。许多国家放弃了疫苗。这种大量的过去两三年，货币超发，整个供应链儿的断裂以及造成的通胀。千万别最后时刻，贪小便宜。
