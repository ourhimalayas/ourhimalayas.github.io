1/4/2023 Miles Guo: The White Paper Movement should be called the “Female White Paper Movement” due to the bravery of the female participants. According to a fellow fighter inside the CCP, the corpses recovered from the Yellow River in Lanzhou and the bodies destroyed by animals on the banks of the Yellow River are more than 10,000 and that fireworks were set off simultaneously across the country within 2-3 hours lately; the president of a certain African country would rather be denounced by the CCP for taking bribes than open its borders to Chinese tourists.
