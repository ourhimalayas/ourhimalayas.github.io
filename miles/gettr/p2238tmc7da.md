12/14/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 25: A man who claimed to be a neighbor living in the neighborhood of Weijian Shan’s daughter came to us and asked us to take down our protest signs with the excuse of us violating relevant rules. Our fellow fighters contended on strong grounds and bravely defended our right to peaceful protest.
