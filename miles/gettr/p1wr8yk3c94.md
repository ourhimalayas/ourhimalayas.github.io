2022.11.04 I think if CCP is going to invade Taiwan before the end of 2022. The so-called State Supply and Marketing Cooperative system will take place around April or May next year. Then by July or August (next year) the CCP will close the border, and enter an absolute state of war preparation and martial law.
To catch bandits, first catch the ringleader. We should prudently and wisely plan beforehand instead of doing it recklessly.
（无LOGO版）我觉得今年年底前，对台湾开战的话，中国的这个所谓的供销社供给，应该在明年四、五月份开始，到七、八月份会进入到一个关闭国门，进入绝对的全国的战备和戒严状态。
一定擒贼先擒王,   一定用智慧的办法达到自己的目的,  而不是莽干。
