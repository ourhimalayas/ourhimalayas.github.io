10/8/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: My buddy from the National Development and Reform Commission of Communist China made the comment that Hong Kong is already dead. The deficit in Hong Kong has reached a historic high and the Hong Kong government is having a hard time paying its employees. Now Hong Kong people are very clear about one thing: they won’t be able to live a good life for a single day if the CCP is allowed to exist!

10/8/2022 文贵盖特：文贵在发改委的哥们儿哀叹，”香港已死！香港的赤字已严重到发不出工资”。香港人非常清楚：只要共产党在，他们不会有一天好日子！
