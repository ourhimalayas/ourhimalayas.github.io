2023.01.05 Since 2015 to date in about 2000 days, many submerged military installations have been deployed around the United States to threaten the country. None of Xi's three meetings in the Middle East was successful. One didn't occur, and the remaining two meetings did not have a satisfactory outcome. The relationship with Saudi Arabia is on the rock, which has sown hatred for Chinese people. Challenging the West is great for our mission of eliminating the CCP, but Chinese people will pay a huge price. 
2015年到今天2000多天的时间，大量的在美国的周边部署潜军事设施，威胁美国。
习在中东的三会，一个没开成，剩下俩没一个圆满的，跟沙特关系还搞砸了。这给中国人埋下的仇恨，和对西方的挑战，对我们灭共是好事，对中共那就别提啦，中国人会付出巨大的代价。
