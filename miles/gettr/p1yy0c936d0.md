American law practitioners at O'Melveny & Myers would have assisted Nazi to build Auschwitz concentration camps during WWII as how they are aiding the CCP to persecute the Chinese people. 

The CCP-owned PAX is represented by Peter Friedman, Stuart M. Sarnoff, Laura Aronsson, and David Harbach of O’Melveny & Myers to go after CCP’s No.1 enemy - the Chinese Whistleblower Movement. 
 
O’Melveny & Myers is a depicable aider and abettor of tyranny that poses the single most existential threat to America!
