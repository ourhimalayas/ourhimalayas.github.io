2022.08.27 WANG Min didn't take money illegally, but he did have affairs with many women. There are specific reasons about how and when WANG Min was arrested. ZHANG Hongwei is a real scumbag, he killed many people. The Whistleblower Movement builds its influence by telling people the truth. Most CCP members are good person, WANG Jian being one example.

王珉没有捞钱，但是男女关系不少。王珉什么时候被抓，怎么被抓，都是有原因的。张宏伟也是个垃圾，害了很多人。爆料革命的魅力就在于，给大家真相。体制内很多人都是好人，王健就是其中之一。
