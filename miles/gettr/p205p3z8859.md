11/28/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL, Japanese people are very friendly. The policemen treated us respectfully. Although the policemen were afraid to speak in public to support us, they nodded to our fellow fighters. Our protest didn’t bring any inconvenience, trouble or noise to locals. On the contrary, we left a good impression to them.

11/28/2022 对邪恶说不，日本的民众很友好。日本警察对新中国联邦的战友们非常客气、很友好。虽然警察不敢说出来，但是他们对战友们点点头。战友们的抗议没有给当地造成任何的麻烦，反而给当地民众留下了很好的印象。
