2022.09.06 Sichuan and Chongqing, throughout the earthquake, when someone was about to run out, they were blocked by so-called "Great White" who were sent to do nucleic acid testing. Isn't that killing people? The basic human rights were denied by the CCP. And so many people are willingly subjected to this evil law. Their basic freedom and right are denied and bring great challenges and risks to life.
四川和重庆整个在地震期间，有人快跑出来的时候，被所谓测核酸的大白给拦在那，这不是杀人吗？当任何法律，当任人威胁的我的安全，而且是非正当理由的时候，我都有正当防卫的权利，这叫基本人权。但这个权利被剥夺了，这么多人甘愿被这种恶法， 被剥夺的基本的自由和权利，带来了生命上巨大挑战和风险。
