2022.09.14 If we do not love our family or loved ones, running towards freedom and light is impossible. Some fighter fellows are so arrogant and conceited that it is hard for them to get along with people. The more I get along with these fighter fellows, The more determined I am that I will live in seclusion in the mountains after taking down the CPP. Only by relying the power of righteousness, kindness, altruism and selflessness, we can run towards freedom and light.
如果我们不爱家人或自己的亲人，奔向自由和光明是不可能的。但是很多战友自以为是，大头症很严重，真的很难与人相处，我是越和战友相处，我越坚定灭共以后隐居山林。只有依靠正念、善念、利他无我之心的力量，我们才能奔向自由和光明。
