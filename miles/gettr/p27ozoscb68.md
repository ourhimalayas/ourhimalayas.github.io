2/7/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 80: Something strange happened during the peaceful protest near the residence of the CCP’s pawn Yang Jian’ao this morning. A man who claimed to be a policeman asked fellow fighters about a person named "Cheng Gong", from whom he received an email, saying that he’s the leader of the fellow fighters and asked him to talk in person. However, fellow fighters replied that there was no such person. So, let’s see what will happen next.
