9/13/2022 Miles Guo: After Wang Min was detained, Dai Yongge and Cheung Chung-kiu passed the words to Wang Min that he’d better commit suicide. In addition, they warned Wang Min that Meng Jianzhu, Wang Qishan and Zeng Qinghong knew each of Wang Min’s move and if he dared to say anything bad against them, he would be silenced at anytime; Meng Jianzhu took away all Wang Min’s valuables, and got rid of nearly everyone who was in charge of Wang Min’s case; we hope “Xi the Sun” could return to Beijing alive so that he will get to know the truth behind Wang Min’s case and eliminate those who want him dead during his foreign trip.

9/13/2022 文贵直播：王珉被抓后，戴永革张松桥等人传话让他自杀，并警告他：孟建柱、王岐山和曾庆红掌握其一举一动，若他敢提这些人会随时被灭口；孟侵吞王珉的财宝并干掉了王珉专案组的大部分人；我们希望“习太阳”能活着回到北京、了解王珉案真相、干掉希望他折戟沉沙的人！
