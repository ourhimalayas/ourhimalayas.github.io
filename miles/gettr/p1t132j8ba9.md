2022.10.03 Iran’s Caesaropapism rule, its killing people without a second thought, and its Revolutionary Guard are astounding. None of Khamenei’s henchmen had the guts to take advantage of opportunities when doing business with others for their own benefits. Even the price of eggs in Iran is almost under full control of Khamenei's family.
（无LOGO版）伊朗那种政教合一的统治，那种杀人不眨眼的方式，和革命卫队，是很夸张的。哈梅内伊的人的不敢做事的时候为自己谋利。甚至几乎伊朗的鸡蛋价格都是哈梅内伊家族全部控制着。
