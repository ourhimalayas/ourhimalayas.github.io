2022.09.04 Miles Guo: Now CCP considers Zero-Covid and Quarantine policies as the policy of governance; The decoupling of Technology and Trade between the CCP China and the USA is accelerating; There is no way out for Communist China to maintain its economy development through trading with Southeast Asia and Central-to-East Europe; Miles has a biggest and deepest concern for China: During the process of decoupling,  if China is turned into today’s Iran, even in a short of time, it’s completely over.
9/4/2022 文贵直播：现在中共国把清零和隔离政策当成了治国方针；而中美科技和贸易脱钩在加速进行中；中共国靠东南亚和中东欧来做出口贸易来维护经济发展不可行；文贵先生最大的担心是在中美脱钩进程中，中共国变成伊朗，甚至只是一段时间变成伊朗，那样就完了。
