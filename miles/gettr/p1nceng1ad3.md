8/17/2922 Miles Guo: Although the CCP kleptocrats' children are also victims, exposing these children is to make them realize that their wealth and privileges are built on top of the hardship of countless regular Chinese children and families. The stupidity, ignorance, and cowardice of some Chinese people have allowed the CCP to rule China. The most horrible thing in the world is to find excuses for one's own cowardice and ignorance, which will facilitate evil.

8/17/2022 文贵直播：虽然中共盗国贼的孩子也是受害者，但曝光这些孩子是为了让他们认识到，他们的财富和特权是建立在无数普通的中国孩子和家庭的痛苦的基础上。一些中国人的愚昧、无知和懦弱让中共得以霸占中国，世界上最可怕的是人为自己的懦弱和无知找理由从而助纣为虐
