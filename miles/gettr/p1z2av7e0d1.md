Local Chinese Americans started peaceful protest in front of Luc Despinsâ€™ house in Greenwich, CT today.  Neighbors and community police stopped by and said helloðŸ˜ƒ They all greatly appreciate seeing such a quiet, civil and peaceful protest. It is very hard for people to imagine Luc Despins/Paul Hastings would take CCPâ€™s command and money ðŸ’´to throw these peaceful Chinese dissidents into jail! Neighbors told protestors that Luc is a difficult person and his ex-wife would want to stand on our side!ðŸ˜ƒ#lucadespins #paulhastings #pag #pax
