2022.09.04 Miles Guo: The CCP is using the so-called Guerrilla warfare against Taiwan. It is the warfare of rogues and the warfare of liars; The CCP will keep harassing Taiwan and attack it when it is numb. Miles has no grudge with Guo Guangchang, but just not bear his recent cooperation with the CCP on the matter of vaccines, created a platform of intelligence for the CCP and detest him cheating so much of the common people’s money in Xingye Bank and the Bank of Shanghai. 
9/4/2022 文贵直播：中共对台就是用的所谓游击战，就是流氓战，就是骗子战。中共会不断骚扰台湾，在其麻木时攻台；七哥和郭广昌无恩怨，就是看不惯他在疫苗上和共产党合作。憎恨他为共产党搞情报平台，以及在兴业银行上海银行骗了这么多老百姓钱。
