2022.09.12 “I think between the husband and wife, there should be mutual respect and mutual compromise. I think this is a delicate guideline, which requires your own interpretation. Given the different life experience, different understanding, different state, different culture, it is very very tough.”
“我觉得应该是夫妻之间表示相互尊重，相互妥协。我觉得，这是一个很难把握的标准，只能靠自己理解了。修行不同，理解不同，境界不同，文化不同，非常非常难。”
