ðŸ—½New York top lawyer Steven Arenson discussed with Nicole about the peaceful protest against Paul Hastings in Grand Central Station. 
ðŸ—½As a Jewish person, Mr. Arenson can relate to the plight of the Chinese dissidents  who are being brutally persecuted by the CCP. 
ðŸ—½He believed the issue with American law firms representing CCPâ€™s interests is more than a legal issue. It is a political issue that requires the US government to sanction the CCP.  #paulhastings #ruleoflaw #lucadespins #pax #shanweijian
