12/05/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL, fellow fights from NFSC Japan Tokyo Sakura Farm continue to protest against CCP’s accomplices, Paul Hastings and its lawyer Luc Despins in Tokyo, Japan. Fellow fighters made wonderful speeches. Xiaoxiaoye couple have been in Japan for more than 30 years. They came from Osaka to join the protest. They said they stand up not only for themselves, but also for the next generation. They want to expose the darkness of the CCP and awaken the kind Japanese.
