12/30/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL, fellow fighters continue to protest in Tokyo, Japan. Due to the New Year holiday, there are not many people in the area where Paul Hastings office building is located. So fellow fighters move their protest site to the Shinjuku Station, the second largest crowded train station in Japan, where there are more pedestrians. Fellow fighters will return to protest in front of the Paul Hastings office building on January 4, 2023.

12/30/2022 对邪恶说不，战友们继续在日本东京进行抗议活动。由于新年假期，普衡所在的区域没什么人。所以战友们把抗议地点转移到了日本第二大人流量的车站，东京的新宿车站，那里有更多的行人。战友们将在2023年1月4日回到普衡办公楼前继续进行抗议。
