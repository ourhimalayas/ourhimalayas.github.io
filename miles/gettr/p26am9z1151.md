1/23/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 65: The protest in front of the building of Yang Jian’ao was disrupted by some Chinese, who recorded the fellow fighters on-site and threatened that the protest has disturbed the neighbors; the police didn’t accept the fake complaints and was willing to offer protection to the protest

1/23/2023 对邪恶说不第65天：战友在杨建翱楼下的抗议遭到华人捣乱，对战友录像、恐吓抗议的行为已对邻居造成骚扰，警察不但未接受捣乱者的投诉，而且还愿意为战友们的抗议提供保护
