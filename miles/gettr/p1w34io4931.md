2022.10.30 The U.S. didn’t welcome Xi with open arms, during his state visit. Xi Jinping immediately went to Russia. Accompanied by Putin, Xi visited Russia’s national defense center. Xi was alarmed by the U.S. troops and missile defense systems deployment around China. After Xi’s North Korea visit and exchanges with Kim Jong-un between the 19th and 20th National Congress meetings, XI adopted North Korea’s execution of Jang Seong-taek, to strike fear into anyone who holds a different opinion against him, establishing himself as an absolute center of power.
（无LOGO版）习近平出访美国后，由于美国对中国不友好，习近平立即出访俄罗斯。在普京陪同下，参观了俄罗斯国防中心，被美国在中共周围布置的军队导弹系统所震慑。在北朝鲜与金正恩交流后，在十九大到二十大之间，利用北朝鲜，张成泽犬决事件，让中共内部不敢有人对习有任何意见，一切以习为中心。
