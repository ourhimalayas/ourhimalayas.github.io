8/28/2022 Miles Guo：The normal way of the CCP kleptocrats to launder money is through their bagmen such as Zhang Songqiao, Zhang Li, Ma Mingzhe and etc., who invest their bosses' money in real estate or finance. After that, the money will be transferred multiple times through various transactions in different areas, and it will end up in the cryptocurrency market and be converted into Bitcoins. The whole process of money laundering will become untraceable once Bitcoin transactions happen.

8/28/2022 文贵直播：共产党洗钱的最常规手法是通过张松桥、张力、马明哲等这些白手套们，用他们的钱购置房地产或金融产品，然后再多次买进卖出，在此过程中，进入数字货币交易所转换成比特币，一旦在数字货币市场交易了，洗钱的过程则无迹可寻
