9/13/2022  Miles Guo’s GETTR: After the Russia-Ukraine war ends and Russia disintegrates, the U.S. and the West will fully concentrate on fighting against the CCP in Hong Kong in the financial war, and confronting the CCP in hot wars in the East China Sea and Taiwan; If something happened to Xi during his visit to Kazakhstan, for examples, his plane got shot down, or Russians surrendered or Putin got assassinated, Hong Kong’s situation would become much worse.

9/13/2022  文贵盖特：美国和西方在俄乌战争结束俄罗斯解体后，会全力在香港和中共打金融战，同时在东海和台湾也将有火战；如果习访问哈萨克斯坦出现问题，如出现折戟沉沙的事，或俄罗斯投降或普京被干掉，香港的形势会更惨
