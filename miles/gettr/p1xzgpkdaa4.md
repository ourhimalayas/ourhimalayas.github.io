11/12/2022 Miles Guo's GETTR: Who was the first to say that Twitter would go bankrupt? Behind the overnight collapse of FTX was the Chinese Communist Party, which originally planned to clean up its competitor, FTX. But the CCP didn't expect the entire crypto community in the world would realize that Changpeng Zhao works for the CCP due to the fall of FTX. #Twitter #CCP #Russia #FTX #Binance #CZ

11/12/2022 文贵盖特：是谁最早说过推特要破产？中共因俄罗斯搬起石头砸了自己的脚；FTX一夜破产的背后也是共产党，中共本想借此来清理对手，未曾想全世界币圈都因此得知币安赵长鹏是共产党的 #推特 #中共 #俄罗斯 #FTX #币安 #赵长鹏
