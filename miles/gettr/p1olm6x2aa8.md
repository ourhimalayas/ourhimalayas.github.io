2022.08.28 Miles Guo: No matter what kind of illusion the U.S. and the West had for the CCP. Ultimately, they will be faced with one issue: the life-or-death rivalry between the Chinese Communist Party and the West. Taking decisive action is the only way to deal with the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party must be defeated and eliminated. There is no room for negotiation and backing up. 
郭先生：不管美国和西方有多少幻想，最后都面临一个问题：你不干掉中共，中共就弄死你们。对待共产党， 只有行动。只有把他撂倒， 只有把他消灭，没有任何交易和退步的空间。
