2022.12.06 The reason why  the US knows so little about the crimes of the CCP and Paul Hastings is because the CCP controls the media and has censored all information unfavorable to it. I feel very grateful for the US justice system because if I were in Communist China, I would have been disappeared long ago.
为什么美国不了解中共，不了解普衡的罪恶，因为所有有关普通百姓被欺骗的信息，都被媒体控制了。我特别感动美国法律系统，我要在中共国，我早被消失了。
