2022.08.29 Miles Guo: A top athlete in her prime facing the once-a-lifetime opportunity, the Olympics Game, had to purposely lose the match while being fully aware of her opponent’s inappropriate relationship with the coach who masterminded the match-making. What a horror it is!

20828-10郭先生：一位顶级球员面对着一生的职业生涯，就这一次机会，世界奥运会，不得不故意输掉比赛，面对的还是跟策划假输球的领导有不正当关系的对手。这是多么恐怖的事情啊!
