12/07/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 18:  Fellow fighters of NFSC stand with the Jewish community, fighting against not just antisemitism, not just the suppression of Chinese dissident voices all over the world, but any kind of persecution.

12/07/2022 对邪恶说不 第18天：新中国联邦人与犹太群体站在一起，不仅反对反犹太主义，不仅反对压制世界各地中国异见人士的声音，而且反对任何形式的迫害。这让此前曾对卢克和普衡发起道德投诉的犹太律师埃利奥特·多迪克来到现场支持战友们的抗议。
