12/16/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 32: A couple of days ago, outside the home of Weijian Shan's daughter on the West Coast, an unknown SUV appeared, and the driver threw a bottle filled with unknown liquid towards a female fellow fighter participating in the peaceful protest. And in Manhattan yesterday, someone drove a car and deliberately hit and injured a fellow fighter. Was this a coincidence? Who is behind the scenes?

12/21/2022 对邪恶说不 第32天：几天前，在西海岸单伟建女儿家外，有不明车辆经过并向参与和平抗议的女战友投掷装有不明液体的瓶子；而在曼哈顿，昨天有人开车故意撞伤战友；这难道是巧合吗？谁是背后黑手？
