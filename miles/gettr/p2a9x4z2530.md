2023.03.02 After Biden became the President of the United States, no one expected our New Federal State of China ( NFSC) to hunker down for two years to welcome the day when Mr. McCarthy became Speaker of the House and to welcome the checks and balances that come with the separation of legislative, executive and judicial powers in the United States. After surviving the darkest year of 2021, the NFSC pulled through, made it to Phoenix and was invited to CPAC to appear on the world political stage.
拜登当选总统后，没人能想到我们新中国联邦能蛰伏两年等到了麦肯锡议长和美国的三权鼎立。挺过了最黑暗2021年，新中国联邦杀出一条血路，冲向凤凰城，又受邀出席CPAC，亮相世界政治舞台。
