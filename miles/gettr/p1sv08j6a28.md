10/1/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The depreciation of RMB is the CCP’s scheme to challenge the U.S. dollar. The CCP is attempting to ruin the plan of the U.S. to attract the U.S. dollar to flow back to the U.S. from all over the world, and then replace the dominance of the U.S. dollar with its own currency through the digitalization of the RMB. Just like what Taiwan and Hong Kong have been through, the U.S. is facing the same situation that American traitors have become the biggest threat to the U.S., which can be proved by all the unrestricted judicial warfare and media warfare against me over these years.

10/1/2022  文贵盖特： 中共让人民币贬值实为挑战美元，打破美国想让全球美元回流的计划，同时通过人民币数字化最终取代美元的全球主导地位；和台湾、香港一样，美国面临的最大威胁也来自内部的卖美贼，从我这几年在美国经历的法律媒体超限战来看可见一斑。
