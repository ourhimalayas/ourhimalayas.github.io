2023.01.07 Mr. Miles Guo Gettr: The CCP is afraid that the whistleblowers’ movement will ignite the fire in the hearts of the Chinese people. In order to prevent the spread of the fire revolution, the production of fireworks is not allowed from now on, and even the existing fireworks and raw materials will be destroyed. Chinese people will not be able to celebrate Chinese New Year this year, and this year will be the last year of the CCP!
中共害怕暴力革命会点燃中国人心中的那团火，为防止火焰革命的蔓延，从现在起不允许生产烟花，甚至要销毁现有的烟花和原材料。中国的老百姓今年是过不了年了，今年会是中共的最后一个年了！
