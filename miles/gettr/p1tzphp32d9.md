2022.10.12 I said before that the Crimean Bridge, once got exploded, Putin would definitely go crazy. The two new military leaders that he chose are very crazy, psychopathic. The maniacs, also, the guy in Chechnya is a pervert. Don't worry, the next step for the U.S., Europe, and NATO is to target behead these new officials for sure.
（无LOGO版）我说了这个克雷米亚大桥，只要一炸, 普京一定疯狂。他选的这两个新的军队的领导是很疯狂的，变态狂，狂人，还有车臣那个货，那就是变态。你放心，下一步美国、欧洲、北约一定把这几个新上任的官给他定点清除掉。
