【NFSC @CPAC 】03/04/2023  Lead Strategist of Ignite 45 Ignacio Falco  @ignacio_falco :  The big-tech is partially responsible for the mess that we're in. And we're all suffering from that mess. Our economy or school systems are all hurting. And it's wholly due to the censorship that's been taking place.
