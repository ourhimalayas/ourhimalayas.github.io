12/21/2022 SAY NOT TO EVIL, fellow fighters who are protesting in Tokyo, Japan said that they would not be thwarted by the attack that happened on our fellow fighter Nick while protesting in the US. Instead, it would bring out more fighting spirit to us. We are determined to take down the evil CCP and let the world will no longer have such a large slave country.

12/21/2022 向邪恶说不，在日本东京的抗议的战友们表示，不会因为我们的战友尼克在美国抗议时遭到的攻击而受挫。相反，这将更加激励我们的斗志，决心打倒邪恶的中共，让世界不再有如此大的奴隶制国家。
