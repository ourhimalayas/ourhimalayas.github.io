10/10/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The strength of a country does not come from land, but comes from the quality of its people, its technology and government system. If the Chinese nation has an open mind, it should let Taiwan become independent! As I said earlier, if the Crimean Bridge is blasted, Putin will become crazy. The bombing of Kyiv is just the beginning of Putin’s insane actions; the CCP’s navy and air force have some abnormal activities lately. We are also aware of the CCP’s military programs in South America!

10/10/2022 文贵盖特：一个国家的强大并非靠土地，而是人民素质、科技和政权制度。若中华民族有胸怀，就应让台湾独立！正如文贵所说：若克里米亚大桥被炸，普京会疯狂，基辅被炸就是普京疯狂举动的开始。最近中共的海军、空军有异动，我们也掌握中共在南美的军事项目！
