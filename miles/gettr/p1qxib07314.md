2022.09.14 Right now, the CCP Ministry of Finance has to cut down the budget of the Political and Legal Committee. The police, Political and Legal Committee, and the public prosecutors turn their guns and start burning and looting as soon as they run out of money. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) started and grew with burning, killing, and looting. Everyone knows it's over. The CCP at all levels is now in the name of anti-corruption burning, killing, blackmailing and extorting in the entire China.
中共财政部削减全国政法委开支。警察,政法委,公检法没钱了就开始调转枪口,烧杀抢掠。共产党就是烧杀抢发家的。都知道完了。中共在全国各个层次以反腐为名烧杀抢掠,敲诈勒索。.
