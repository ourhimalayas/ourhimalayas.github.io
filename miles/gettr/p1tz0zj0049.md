10/11/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Hong Kong’s economic prosperity is severely fabricated in order to serve the purpose of holding the 20th Party Congress. It will cause many people to lose their entire fortune, even their lives. The implementation of zero-Covid policy before the opening of the 20th Party Congress is simply for the purpose of social stress test prior to the war and is also an excuse to arrest people and deprive them of their money; the CCP is currently committing Nazi crime to an outrageous extent by arresting the so-called potential agitators across the country.

10/11/2022 文贵盖特：香港经济的严重造假就是服务于中共的二十大，它必将导致无数人倾家荡产甚至丧命；中共二十大前的清零就是战争前社会压力测试、抓人和抢夺财产的一个借口；中共目前正在犯下纳粹般的罪行，到处抓捕所谓不稳定分子，已到了丧心病狂的程度
