01/17/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 59:  A lawyer who knows Luc well told us that Luc is awful and a typical anti-Semite. Many of Luc's clients are outraged by his behavior but dare not speak out against him, and his peers are ashamed of him.

01/17/2023 对邪恶说不 第59天：一位熟悉卢克的律师告诉我们，此人非常糟糕，并且是一个典型的反犹主义者。卢克的很多客户都对他敢怒不敢言，他的律师同行也都为他的行为感到羞耻。
