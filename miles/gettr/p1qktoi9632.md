2022.09.12 All marriages in China hinge on if the groom's family is rich or powerful. Kickbacks, benefit-exchanges, and ruthless marital relationships make up the secular society. The Communist Party that has kept us from being civilized, Chinese is steeply into patriarchy, lineage, and marital interests too.

中国所有的婚姻基男方家是否有钱，是否有权。整个中国的民间，就是个行贿受贿、利益交换、泯灭人性的婚姻关系。不仅仅是共产党让我们远离了文明，中国是绝对的骨子里面，是重男轻女、传宗接代、婚姻利益。
