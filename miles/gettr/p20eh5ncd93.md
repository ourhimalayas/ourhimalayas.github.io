12/01/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 12: Christmas is approaching, but the Connecticut house of Luc Despins, who held the candle for the evil and committed all the evil deeds, is lifeless. The purpose of us coming to Luc’s house to protest is to spread what we saw on the spot to the whole world in a timely manner, so that people can hear the voices of the people of the NFSC and see the long-term, short-term, and current situation of those evildoers.

12/01/2022 对邪恶说不 第12天：临近圣诞节，但助纣为虐且坏事做尽的卢克康州的家却死气沉沉。我们来到Luc家抗议的目的那就是要把现场看到的及时地传到全世界，让人们听到新中国联邦人的声音，也看到那些作恶的人长期、短期和当下的境遇。
