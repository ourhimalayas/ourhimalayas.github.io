2022.11.03 But I told you beforehand，around a week ago just about the starting time of Zhengzhou disaster. All my previous employees from Yuda Palace Hotel working in Foxcoon, witnessed and participated the whole event. They initiated the resistance of the evil Covid lockdown before things got worse. I am proud to say that they have inherited my DNA and spirit to fight against evil with wisdom. Without them, the death roll found in Foxcoon plant would be far more. 
（无LOGO版）全人类只有七哥一个人说过， 一周前了吧，就是郑州刚刚有动静的时候，那全部都是咱们裕达的老员工，这些人是亲眼目睹了整个事情， 而且最早提出来反抗的就是他们，这就是七哥的DNA。要没有这些裕达的老员工，富士康会死更多人。
