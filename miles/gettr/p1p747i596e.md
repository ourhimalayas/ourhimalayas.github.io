2022.09.01 It is the age of the Internet. In these past years, the CCP was by deception to the United States and Europe, trade agreements, and the so-called cooperation with the West. So that's why the CCP went from a GDP of a trillion dollars or so in the year 2000 suddenly became $15 trillion USD. So, in the last 30 years, the Communist Party has become the so-called miracle worker of the world. It's called a deception-creating nation. What's next? Right, will it be able to sustain it?

今天是互联网时代。中共过去这些年，骗取了奥运会，骗取了贸易协定。所以说，中共从过去的2000年一万多亿的GDP，突然变成15万亿美元。它获得了一个不是金融制度，而是靠骗取的西方所谓的以自由和民主来政治转型为理由，欺骗的西方贸易协定，来暂时性的拥有了养军队的和养政府的巨大的金融能力。
