9/4/2022 Miles Guo: Facebook, Twitter, Google and etc. will all be held accountable by both U.S. parties for their involvements in political fights and COVID vaccination propaganda. TikTok and Zoom will be kicked out of the U.S. market, and they will be facing sanctions afterwards, which is the second step of the sci-tech decoupling, that is to completely block their access to chips and internet. In that case, they wouldn’t be able to survive even if they went back and owned the entire Chinese market. Both U.S. parties have reached the “Washington Consensus” which aims to end the CCP.

9/4/2022 文贵直播：脸书、推特、谷歌等都将因推广疫苗和参与政治斗争而被美国两党追责；抖音和Zoom也会被踢出美国市场，并面临科技脱钩的第二步，即被完全限制芯片和网络的使用，即使它们回到中国市场也将无法生存；美国两党已形成了结束中共的“华盛顿共识”。
