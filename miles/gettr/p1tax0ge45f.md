2022.10.06 Regarding my Hudson speech which is the first Whistleblower Movement，Sun, Lijun, (former Vice Minister of the Ministry of Chinese Public Security,) warned me as below: “Miles, not only you will never be able to give a speech at Hudson, but nowhere else in US as well. He said: “Anywhere in the United States and Europe, I can restrain you.”
（无LOGO版）就那个哈德逊那个演讲的事， 那孙立军原话说：“你甭说是哈德逊演讲给你干掉， 你到美国任何地方你演讲都不行”。 他说：“不要说在美国， 在美国任何地方，包括欧洲，我让你寸步难行”
