DVS 7.0 is a Latin-American. A rapper, spoken word poet and Christian conservative activist, he is young and charismatic, with a strong belief that God will bless those who do what is right. In response to the Chinese Communist Party's blocking and shielding of Mr. Guo's songs and censorship of karaoke, DVS 7.0 points out that the Communist Party's control of people's right to speak and suppression of the truth shows that the dictatorship is afraid of the people's voice.
DVS 7.0 will perform "I Need Ya", and "Let Me Be A Child" at the grand finale.
