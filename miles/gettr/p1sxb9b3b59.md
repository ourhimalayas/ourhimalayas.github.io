10/2/2022 Miles Guo: The core family members of Ali Khamenei are still in Iran. Neither will Iran have a new supreme leader like Khamenei, nor will it have American-style democracy overnight. The death of Khamenei is a psychological blow to Xi Jinping, and the relationship between Iran and the CCP will get even more complicated. So, this is a God-given great opportunity to take down the CCP! The CCP's infiltration in the Middle East will be changed, with its Belt and Road Initiative being basically finished. The Middle East will undergo a major shift!
