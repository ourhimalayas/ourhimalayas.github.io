10/8/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: I said a month ago that the bridge connecting Crimea and Russia would be blasted, and it just happened; inflation has been rampant around the world, particularly in South America and Africa. A club in London, which is one of the best assets over there, was just sold at a discount; there is a saying in the Fashion sector: “Many brand names are already dead, and they just pretend to be alive”.

10/8/2022 文贵盖特：文贵早在1个月前就说过克里米亚通往俄罗斯的大桥会被炸，果然发生了；世界各地通货膨胀严重，尤其是在南美州、非洲，连伦敦最好物业之一的一个俱乐部都被打折出售；现在Fashion(时尚)领域有一句话：时尚界很多牌子其实已经死了，只是装活着。
