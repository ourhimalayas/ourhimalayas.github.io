11/24/2022  SAY NO TO EVIL: After Weijian Shan asked Mr. Guo to discuss a reconciliation, Luc Despins became nervous and immediately approached Mr. Guo on his own initiative for a meeting. Luc’s purpose was to impede the ongoing reconciliation negotiation so he could extort huge amounts of money from Mr. Guo. His act is an outright challenge to the limits of the U.S. judicial system.

11/24/2022  对邪恶说不：在单伟建找到郭先生商量和解的过程中，卢克紧急找到郭先生安排了一次见面，企图通过阻止和解来对郭先生进行巨额敲诈勒索，这是对美国司法系统底线的彻底挑战。
