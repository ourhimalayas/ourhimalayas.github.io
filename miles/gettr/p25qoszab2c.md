1/19/2023 We Fight for Justice Day 1: Our fellow fighters received support from people of different ages and ethnic groups! An old couple is very aware of the evil deeds committed by the CCP in the US; an immigrant from the Middle East thinks that our fellow fighters are not just fighting for the Chinese, but also for all immigrants who came to the US to pursue freedom and democracy; a young American is really touched by the courage of citizens of the New Federal State of China!

1/19/2023 国会山抗议SEC第一天：战友们得到了不同年龄和族裔的支持！一对老夫妇非常了解中共在美国所做的恶；一位中东移民表示，战友们不仅为中国人，也为所有追求自由民主的美国移民伸张正义；一位美国年轻人被新中国联邦人的勇气感动！
