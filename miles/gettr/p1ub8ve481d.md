10/14/2022 Miles Guo: My friends in Europe told me that many European officials have taken Covid vaccines because they believe in science; my Greek rich friend said that his entire family members were all vaccinated,  and he was falling apart because he couldn’t find any individual in his family that could produce healthy sperm or eggs. Panic over the Covid vaccine disaster has emerged in Europe. As the member of the New Federal State of China, we should be grateful and cherish our state of being unvaccinated

10/14/2022 文贵盖特：我的欧洲朋友说，欧洲很多政府官员因相信科学而打了新冠疫苗，我的希腊富豪朋友说，他全家都打了新冠疫苗，他因无法在家族里找到一个能有健康的精子或卵子的成员而崩溃，整个欧洲对疫苗灾难的恐慌始现。新中国联邦人要感恩和珍惜我们是无苗一族的身份。
