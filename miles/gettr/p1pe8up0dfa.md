2022.09.02 How does Cheung Chung-kiu launder money for the CCP kleptocrats? Firstly, the money is used to invest in realestate and financial products. The proceeds of the sale of such assets is then further laundered through Blackrock and Ma Mingzhe, where it enters the digital currency market. Ultimately, the money ends up in Bitcoins where it is untraceable. This is how they have always done it. 

张松桥是怎么替坑里人洗钱？第一道关，投资了金融买了地产。 这些地产卖下去，洗钱的钱再卖给自己人， 如美国黑石，马明哲。在洗的过程当中，进入了数字货币市场，买了火币，最后落到比特币。到了比特币市场一交易，你永远查不着。这是他们一贯洗钱的招。
