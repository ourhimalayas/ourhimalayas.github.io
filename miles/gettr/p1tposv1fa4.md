10/9/2022 Miles Guo: Elon Musk’s recent suggestions on Ukraine and Taiwan all serve his purpose of running for president. He is yearning for not only obtaining political and economic powers but also being honored, but nobody has ever succeeded in doing so in human history. His business and companies will have big trouble because of his ties with the CCP. He will eventually find out that his biggest enemy is the CCP.

10/9/2022 文贵直播：伊隆·马斯克最近对乌克兰和台湾的建议都是为了总统竞选而为。他不但想得到政治和经济上的权力，而且还要得到荣誉，这个历史上还无一人能成功。他的生意和公司都会因为中共而碰到大麻烦，他最终会发现中共是他最大的敌人。
