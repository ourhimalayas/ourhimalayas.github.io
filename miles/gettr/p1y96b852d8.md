2022.11.14 Our reconciliation with PAG, has become impossible for sure. In this case, no matter what the circumstances are, the opposite side is trying to do everything it can to make you in contempt of court. You can be jailed for contempt of court. And then, you can be fined again, again and again. That is, I have become the one fined the most in the US history.
（无LOGO版）我们跟这个太平联盟的和解，是肯定不可能了。这个案子不论任何情况，对方就是想尽一切办法，就是让你藐视法庭，藐视法庭是可以把你扔到监狱去的。然后呢，可以再罚款，再罚款，就是我成了美国历史以来，最大的罚款。
