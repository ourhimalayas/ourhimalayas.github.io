2022.11.15 Paul Hastings' legal team tried to frame Mr. Guo in the court session.  First, they wanted to protect UBS and take away the deal. Second, they wanted to make the case look like a verdict for Mr. Guo in contempt of court and to fine him more money. Third, they aimed to gather more information for the Communist Party. These American lawyers from Paul Hastings talk just like the CCP’s shuanggui team (which works beyond the regular legal system).
（无LOGO版）普衡的律师团队在开庭上试图给郭先生挖坑，他们第一想保护UBS，把交易拿走，第二，把案子看怎么弄成让郭先生藐视法庭，罚更多的钱，第三，套出更多的信息给共产党。普衡这些美国律师，讲出来的话就像中共的双规组。
