12/28/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 39: After the so-called detective hit our fellow fighter Nick with a car several days ago at the protest site in front of the apartment building where Stuart Sarnoff lives, more suspicious people have come to the site to film us these days. It is obvious that the CCP and its enablers have been trying to use such dirty tricks to stop our peaceful protests.

12/28/2022 对邪恶说不 第39天：在Stuart Sarnoff家的和平抗议现场，自前几天一个所谓“侦探”开车撞伤Nick战友后，又有一些可疑的人来到现场跟拍战友。这显然是中共及其帮凶企图用这种下三滥的招术来阻止我们的和平抗议。
