2022.10.03 Owing to Khamenei's ability to fool, Khomeini treated him like a son. After gaining power post Khomeini's death, Khamenei spied on Khomeini's family by sending Khomeini's son to guard his father's grave and assassinated him to end his influence. Khamenei is exceedingly wicked.
（无LOGO版）哈梅内伊靠着忽悠之术，与霍梅尼维持形同父子一般的关系。待霍梅尼过世以后，哈梅内伊上位便对霍梅尼家族进行监视，把霍梅尼的儿子送去为父亲守坟，并且暗杀了霍梅尼的儿子以阻断其影响力。哈梅内伊此人不是一般的阴险。
