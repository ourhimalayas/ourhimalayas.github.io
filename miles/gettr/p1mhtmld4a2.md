8/13/2022 Miles Guo’ GETTR: When witnessing the decouplings between the U.S. and China in the areas of technology, finance and trade, we must also be aware of judicial decoupling. All the issues associated with my bankruptcy case imply a judicial decoupling between the U.S and Communist China. Americans can’t really understand how deep the CCP’s infiltration is inside the U.S., but some Americans have already realized that it is a must to take down the CCP in order to protect their own people.

8/13/2022 文贵盖特：在看到美中之间的科技脱钩、金融脱钩和贸易脱钩时，我们还要看到法律脱钩。我现在的个人破产案所涉及的这一系列事情就意味着今后美中的法律脱钩。美国人很难了解中共在美国内部的深层渗透，但也有美国人已经认识到消灭中共也是保护美国人的必须。
