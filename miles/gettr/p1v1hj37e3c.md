2022.10.21 This story (the New Yorker published) doesn't tell that, I bought the land before the Olympics. I had already started developing this land before the Olympics. These bastards, the New Yorker really lost the conscience to turn this piece upside down completely. 
（无LOGO版）这篇报道，它没有说七哥是在奥运会以前买的土地，奥运会以前，七哥已经开始开发了。这帮王八蛋，&lt;纽约客&gt;可真是黑了良心呐， 要把这一块彻底颠倒过来 。
