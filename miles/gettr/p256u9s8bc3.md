1/15/2023 Miles Guo: The CCP, which rose to the top through deception, understands the power of the media and public opinions, and they have been using investment returns as bait to lure the Western big families and politicians into collaborating with them. However, the US, Japan, and EU have switched directions recently so that they won’t care if whatever actions they take will interfere with the so-called internal affairs of Communist China. Nor will they consider keeping the CCP in power to enslave the Chinese people. This is huge!
