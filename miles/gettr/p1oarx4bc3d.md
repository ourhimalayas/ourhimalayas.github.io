8/25/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: More and more people are going to funerals, worrying about drought and climate change. However, very few people dare to talk about the death and disasters caused by the COVID vaccines. How pathetic! Humanity is facing many imminent disasters, whereas many governments around the world are trying everything they can to block the advent of digital currencies. Had those governments used a tiny bit of their resources to confront the CCP, many of the disasters could have been avoided!

8/25/2022 文贵盖特：越来越多的人参加葬礼、担忧干旱和气候变化，可悲的是：很少有人敢谈疫苗带来的死亡和灾难！人类正面临着诸多灾难，而全世界的政府却在拼命地阻挠数字货币的到来，但凡他们拿出一点点精力去对付中共，很多灾难都可以避免！
