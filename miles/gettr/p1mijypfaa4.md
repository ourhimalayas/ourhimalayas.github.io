8/13/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Xi Jinping's visit to the US will be the biggest rivalry between the US and the CCP! Xi thinks he can buy all the Americans and make deals with the US, but the US has already started to decouple from the CCP in culture and technology, followed by the financial, trade, and judicial decoupling. If I had been born 10 or 20 years earlier, the CCP wouldn’t have been able to rule Communist China for so many years.

8/13/2022 文贵盖特: 习近平访美将成为中美之间最大的较量！习自以为美国人都能买通而且能跟美国达成交易，可美国已经开始跟中共进行文化和科技脱钩，接下来将进行金融、贸易和司法脱钩；如果文贵早出生十到二十年，中共不可能在中国统治这么多年
