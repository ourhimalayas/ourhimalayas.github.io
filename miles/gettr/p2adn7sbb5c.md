【NFSC @CPAC 】03/02/2023 Candidate for congress Ron Eller: To stop the CCP’s infiltration in the United States, we need to stop the implementation of law enforcement of the CCP within the US borders. And if a member of Congress or any other federal agencies are in collaboration with the CCP, then that needs to be investigated, and action needs to be taken to separate that. This is what I would term treason.

【新中国联邦DC星火行动】03/02/2023  国会议员候选人罗恩·埃乐：停止中共在美国的渗透，我们就需要停止中共在美国境内的执法。如果一个国会成员或者联邦政府机构工作人员与中共勾结，那么我们就需要对他们展开调查。需要采取行动将这种行为区分开来，我会称之为“叛国”
