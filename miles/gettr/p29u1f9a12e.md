02/14/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL, NFSC fellow fighters from Japan continue to protest in front of Paul Hastings office building at Tokyo. Brother Tomato and Mc wenyi talked about the competition of technology led to rapid progress in the semiconductor industry in Japan during 1940s -1960s. CCP always takes shortcuts and uses deceiving tactics to steal the technology of others. The deeper the collusion with CCP, the worse will be the fate of the companies.

02/14/2023 向邪恶说不，新中国联邦日本战友继续在普衡东京办公楼前抗议。番茄哥和MC文艺谈到了1940-1960年代的技术竞争，导致了日本半导体行业的快速发展。中共总是投机取巧，用欺骗的手段来窃取他人的技术。那些与共产党勾结越深的企业，下场会越惨。
#普衡勾结中共 #中共窃取技术
