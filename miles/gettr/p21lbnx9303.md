12/09/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 20: Shan Weijian and his daughter sent people to make trouble at the protest site, while the fellow fighters of the New Federal State of China kept calm and did not conflict with them. Those who came to make trouble left in a hurry without achieving their goals.

12/09/2022 对邪恶说不 第20天：单伟建和他女儿派人在抗议现场捣乱，而新中国联邦战友时刻保持冷静，没有与其发生冲突。来捣乱的人没有达到目的便匆匆离去。
