2022.09.17 The CCP’s target is to indirectly deny revelations of the New Federal State of China (NFSC) one by one. Phoenix Satellite Television is owned 100% by the Ministry of National Security. Phoenix TV and the CCP-controlled overseas media will report NFSC negatively. All these issues indicate that we are the only group of people who pose a threat to the CCP and make them care. That's the reason why we must be always completely truthful.
中共的目标是把所有新中国联邦的爆料一个一个间接的否定。凤凰卫视百分之百是安全部的。
凤凰卫视以及中共控制的海外媒体会负面报道我们。 所有问题只表明我们是唯一对中共造成威胁,让他在乎的一群人。越是这样我们越要坚持唯真不破。
