12/29/2022  Miles Guo:  The high expectations set on me by those warriors in Qingfeng Detention Center and my experience of traveling around the world convinced me of my ability of taking down the CCP. However, the biggest challenge in the course of ending the CCP is people’s hearts that have been ruined by the CCP.  Only by letting go of my desires and ego can I end the CCP, and I’ve made it!

12/29/2022 文贵直播：清丰看守所那些勇士们寄予文贵的厚望，以及之后游历世界的经历让我自知能灭掉中共，而灭共路上最大的困难就是被中共破坏了的人心。只有做到无欲无我才能灭共，而我做到了！
