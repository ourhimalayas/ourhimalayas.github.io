8/22/2022  Miles Guo’s GETTR: Today’s Russia is Putin’s Russia, if something happens to Putin, Russia will fall out with the CCP and target the Northeast China, where a hot war might take place. Notwithstanding that, Xi Jinping is still trying to make an empty promise to the three provinces in the Northeast China. If the Lao Baixing in the Northeast China still want to fantasize that Russians will bring them a promising future, I have to say, it will be their nightmare

8/22/2022 文贵盖特：俄罗斯是普京的俄罗斯，若普京出事，俄罗斯肯定会和中共翻脸，将矛头再次对准中国东北，东北三省或有激烈火战。尽管这样，习近平还要继续给东三省画大饼，如果东北人民还幻想俄罗斯能给他们带来希望的话，只能是一场噩梦！
