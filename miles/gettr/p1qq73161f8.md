2022.09.13 Miles Guo: The current state of the Chinese economy is worse than imagined. The police are openly blackmailing and robbing people, banks restricting cash withdrawals, the CCP government prohibits foreign investors from withdrawing, and the government can not pay salaries.
国内经济一塌糊涂，警察都在公开勒索抢劫老百姓，银行不让取现，政府禁止外资撤离，连国家机关单位都发不出工资了。
