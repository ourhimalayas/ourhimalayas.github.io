2/8/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 81: Upon arrival at the school where Weijian Shan's daughter studies, the fellow fighters were stopped by 11 police officers and a school admin outside the school entrance. After listening to the fellow fighters' explanations, the police also believed that their actions were not illegal or against any regulations, so the fellow fighters were allowed to enter the campus, and they resorted to smart measures to let more Americans know about the evil of the CCP.
