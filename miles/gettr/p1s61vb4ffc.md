2022.09.26 Introduction: From the bottom of my heart, I am grateful to the engineers and investors of Gettr. Gettr is at its infancy and is technically still in the testing phase. It has been established for only one year. It takes at least 3 years for any great platform to mature. 
（无LOGO版）我发自内心的，对盖特的工程师和投资者充满了感激。盖特是个还它还没诞生的孩子，严格讲它在一个测试期，它才一年时间，一个好的平台，没有三年时间是不可能的。
