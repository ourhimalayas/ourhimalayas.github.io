12/31/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 42: A couple verbally insulted our fellow fighter protesters and then grabbed and destroyed all the flyers in a fellow fighter’s hands. Such unusual behavior is unprecedented and could mean someone is behind it.

12/31/2022 对邪恶说不 第42天：前线战友报道，一对夫妇对抗议战友进行了语言攻击，随后抢夺并撕毁了战友手中的传单。这种反常的行为是抗议以来第一次，很有可能背后有人指使。
