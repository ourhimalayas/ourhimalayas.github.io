8/29/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The Zero-COVID policy has caused huge controversies inside the CCP, and the political infightings in the CCP have been increasingly intensified. Zhang Songqiao owns a historical mansion called King Yin Lei, which is a declared monument of Hong Kong. HNA’s Chen Feng and Wang Jian are no match for Zhang Songqiao. The Zeng family has arranged multiple bagmen to monopolize various countries in Europe. The women in Communist China are so pathetic! In the face of the imminent COVID vaccine disaster, fellow fighters should love your parents, family members, friends, and other fellow fighters more!

8/29/2022 文贵盖特： 清零政策在党内引起了巨大争议，政治斗争愈演愈烈；张松桥在香港拥有法定古迹景贤里，海航陈峰和王健和他根本无法相提并论；曾家安排了多个白手套垄断欧洲各国；中共国的女人太可怜了！面对即将到来的疫苗灾难，战友们要更爱父母、家人、朋友和战友！
