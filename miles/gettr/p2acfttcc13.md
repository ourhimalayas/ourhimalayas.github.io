【NFSC@CPAC 】3/2/2023 White House Correspondent Simon Ateba: The Chinese are good people, but the CCP regime is bad. I love the Chinese people as individuals. The CCP is attempting to take over Africa and has launched numerous disinformation campaigns, and Africans are upset with the CCP, not the Chinese. What the CCP has done will endanger ordinary Chinese people since it is hard to tell who is a CCP spy and who is not.  
#Africa #CCP #Chinese≠CCP

【新中国联邦DC星火行动】3/2/2023 白宫记者西蒙·阿提巴：中国人是好人，中共政权是邪恶的，我很喜欢中国人；中共妄图接管非洲并进行了大量虚假信息宣传，非洲人对中共非常不满，而不是对中国人不满；中共的恶行会给华人带来危险，因为外人很难区分谁是中共间谍！
#非洲 #中共 #中国人不等于中共
