10/9/2022 Miles Guo: I don’t believe that Russia dares to use nuclear weapons. Even if that were the case, the U.S. would be able to stop Russia from doing so. However, what is considerably disturbing is that Europe may suffer from the contamination caused by the radiation from the Ukrainian nuclear power plants. The blast of the Crimean Bridge is a fatal blow to Putin, with his political credibility being completely destroyed.
