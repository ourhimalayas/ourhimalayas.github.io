10/15/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The CCP injected 20 billion dollars to support the Hong Kong stock market for the sake of the 20th Party Congress. However, the Hang Seng Index still plummeted to 16,000 points or so. And the CCP spent at least 1 trillion yuan backing the stock market in the mainland. Fearing that the West would support us more, the CCP didn’t dare to mention the Whistleblowers’ Movement during their internal meetings, but only dared to call us the “Color Revolution”. Just in the coming two weeks, the forces to destroy the CCP will be like a typhoon and a hurricane blowing towards the Zhongnanhai Pit (CCP’s power center).

10/15/2022 文贵盖特：为了20大，中共砸了200亿美元撑港股，结果恒指却仍跌到了16000点左右，中共在国内起码花了1万亿人民币护盘；因怕西方更加支持咱们，中共在其内部会议上不敢提爆料革命，只敢说颜色革命；这两周内，灭共的力量将像台风和飓风一样朝中南坑刮去
