10/8/2022 Fay Fay Show: A news report just came out saying that Xu Jiayin is listing the Knightsbridge mansion in London for sale, but Cheung Chung-kiu actually bought that house years ago. Maybe the true owner is Yao Qing. The reason behind this sale is worth our continuous attention.

10/8/2022 飞飞秀：有新闻爆出许家印准备出售伦敦骑士桥区的豪宅，而这个房子是张松桥之前购买的，也许真正的主人应该是姚庆。总之，出售这房子背后的原因值得我们继续关注。
