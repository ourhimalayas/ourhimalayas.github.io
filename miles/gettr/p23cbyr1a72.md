12/27/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL, fellow fighters are continuing to protest in front of Paul Hastings building in Tokyo, Japan. There are many touching stories, one of which is that the wife of our brother Dongyang Long takes care of the fellow fighters in every possible way. She bought hot drinks for everyone and carefully disinfected the cups. She wiped each of the signboards and brought back to home after protesting and repaired the edges of the boards.  

12/27/2022 向邪恶说不，战友们继续在日本东京的普衡办公楼前抗议。有许多感人的故事发生，其中一个就是我们的东洋龙大哥的妻子对战友们无微不至的照顾。她为大家买来热饮，仔细地给杯子消毒。把每块看板都擦得干干净净，抗议后把看板带回家里，并把看板边缘都修补好。
