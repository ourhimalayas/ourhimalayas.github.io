2022.11.05 This is the mankind today. Any hot topics focused by people all over the world will only last for about three weeks. No matter how significant the incident is, the attention has never lasted for more than two months, usually. Hence, the dictators and politicians are so good at. 

（无LOGO版）这就是全人类，面临的就是人们关心的热点话题，3周是一个大限。再大的事不会超过2个月，6周的时间。所以啊，这些独裁们，政治家们都玩的滚瓜烂熟。
