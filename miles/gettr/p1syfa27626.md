10/2/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP has been kept in the dark about Khamenei’s death and the status of Khamenei’s family members and the people close to him. Iranians belittle the CCP, so it is impossible for the CCP to train a religious leader in Iran for its use. Iran and the CCP simply use each other for their own purposes. Khamenei’s death will bring zero impact on Xi’s determination of attacking Taiwan and increase the possibility of war.

10/2/2022  文贵直播： 中共对哈梅内伊的死亡一无所知，对哈梅内伊家人和身边人的行踪也知之甚少。伊朗人根本看不起中共，中共扶持伊朗新宗教领袖一说也就无从谈起，伊朗和中共就是相互利用的关系。另外，哈梅内伊的死非但不会影响习近平攻台决心，反而会增加战争的可能性。
