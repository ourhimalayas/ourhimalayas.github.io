12/31/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL, fellow fighters in Japan continue to protest against Shan Weijian and CCP in Tokyo. They felt that it is their duty to spread the truth, which can overcome the fear of getting infection. They talked about how in the past when they protested at similar locations, who were supporters of the CCP would rush out and scold us. Now there are no such people anymore. They’re slowly awakening up.
12/31/2022对邪恶说不，日本的战友们继续在东京抗议单伟建和中共。他们认为传播真相是他们的责任，超过对感染的害怕。他们也谈到，以前他们在类似地点抗议时，一些是支持中共的人会冲出来骂我们，现在没有这样的人了，他们正在慢慢觉醒。
