2022.10.27 Someone present at the scene told me: The guard went to Hu Jintao and took his spectacles off. These bodyguards and Xi all know that he can't read the file without his spectacles. Have you seen such cruelty towards an old man? Not to mention that this is a former general secretary of the CCP!
（无LOGO版）现场的人告诉我说：警卫上去就把胡锦涛的眼镜拿掉了，这些保镖和习都知道拿掉了眼镜，他念不了稿，你见全世界有人对一个老人那么残酷的吗？就甭说总书记了！
