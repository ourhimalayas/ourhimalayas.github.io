10/9/2022 Miles Guo: The Americans' view that the CCP will not invade Taiwan in the near future is based on the assumption that the CCP has a normal military, economy, and mindset. However, the opposite is true: The CCP’s wars all serve its political infighting. In other words, the CCP uses wars to have the rivals of its senior cadres within the Party killed by the enemies. The disastrous dictatorship of the CCP has kept the Chinese people in a perpetual state of mutual hatred, busy with survival, and in the fear of war.
