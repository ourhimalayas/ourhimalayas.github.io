2022.09.20 In the whole world, we have awakened a lot of people in the west who have conscience and they are now fighting with us. But unfortunately, because of various political interests binding with the CCP, and some people’s personal political stance, a lot of our valuable intelligence failed to play its role at the right time. All of our fellow fighters of the Whistleblower Movement and the NFSC firmly believe that under the present UN framework, the US-centered international order is in the interest of the most majority of human beings. Anyone with a conscience should stand up, otherwise, we’ll be the next victim of the disasters created by the CCP and Putin. 
（无LOGO版）在全世界，我们唤醒了很多人，西方有良知的人和我们一起战斗。但不幸的是，由于各种政治利益与中共绑架在一起，以及个人政治取向，很多我们有价值的情报，没有在适当的时间发挥作用。
