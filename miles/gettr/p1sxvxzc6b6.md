10/2/2022 Miles Guo:  The purposes of the CCP manipulating the depreciation of the RMB are firstly to challenge the U.S. dollar and impede its backflow to the U.S.; secondly, to maintain the CCP’s regime. The CCP is attempting to turn more Chinese people into slave laborers through devaluing the RMB so that the U.S. and the West will continue their collusion with the CCP for the huge economic interests, and the CCP will then be able to keep its ruling power in China.

10/2/2022  文贵直播：中共操控人民币贬值一方面要挑战美元，阻止美元回流，另一方面是维护其政权的需要。中共企图通过人民币贬值将更多中国人变为奴工，使得美国和西方为了巨大经济利益继续和中共勾兑，从而使其政权得以保全。
