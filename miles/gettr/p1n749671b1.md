8/17/2022 Miles Guo: Tian Wei was the CCP's bagman from the most grassroots level. His philosophy of life is about women, power, and networking. Tian Wei could walk into the Organization Department of the CCP's Central Committee just like entering into his own home. Peng Liyuan's benefactor Song Xinbin helped Tian Wei buy off Luneng Group. It was through Tian Wei that Xiao Jianhua got to know Zeng Wei (Zeng Qinghong's son). Ling Jihua, Huo Ke, Liang Guanglie, Chen Bingde, Xu Caihou, Guo Boxiong, and Li Peng would go to Tian Wei's Xiao Baisha Club almost every day.

8/17/2022 文贵直播：田伟是从草根出来的中共白手套，其人生哲学是女人、权力和介绍关系，田伟进入中组部如进他家；彭丽媛的恩人宋新斌帮田伟搞定了鲁能；肖建华通过田伟认识了曾维；令计划、霍克、梁光烈，陈炳德、徐才厚、郭伯雄和李鹏几乎天天都去田伟的小白鲨俱乐部
