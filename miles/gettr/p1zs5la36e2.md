2022.11.26 So, the 18th floor (The Sherry Netherland) and Lady May will definitely become two of the greatest iconic properties and landmarks in the history of the United States. No matter what, they have exceeded the value of the ship and the property themselves. They are the totemic symbol of the Whistleblower movement and the New Federal State of China, representing the time we had been through. 
所以18楼和Lady May, 它绝对是美国历史上未来最最伟大的一个标志性的物业和建筑，不论如何它已经超出了它船和这个物业的价值。一个爆料革命，新中国联邦的这种图腾象征，走过的时间。
