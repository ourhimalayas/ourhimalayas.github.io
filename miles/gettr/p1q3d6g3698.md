2022.09.07 Xi loves to set unrealistic goals and wants to achieve superior outcome, lead the world, and change the world’s game rule. Using the network of ASEAN, SCO, and financial institutions in Asia, Xi wants to confront the America and Europe. Xi even spent a great effort trying to let Japan stay away from his combat with America and Europe, which would surely be his own delusion. 

习好大喜功，想领导世界，改变世界游戏规则，依靠东盟，上合组织和亚洲金融机构对抗美国和欧洲，花了大量心血要让日本不参与到中美欧大战中，这当然是妄想。
