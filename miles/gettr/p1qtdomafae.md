9/13/2022 Miles Guo: It cost the CCP $10-15 billion for Xi to be awarded the Order of Friendship in Uzbekistan! The previous recipients of this Order from Communist China were all corrupt people engaged in foreign diplomacy. Wang Yilin once told me that he could let me do whatever I wanted in many Central Asian countries and have virgins accompany me every day. A businessman who will go on the trip with Xi and whom I have known for years not only had to lose money, but he will also suffer from taking the anal swab and throat swab tests.

9/13/2022 文贵直播：中共花了100-150亿美元才让习在乌兹别克斯坦被授予友谊勋章！中共国之前被授予该勋章的人都是利用外交搞腐败的；王宜林曾告诉文贵说他能让我在中亚为所欲为，天天有处女陪；一位要跟习出访的文贵认识多年的商界人士不仅赔了钱，还要受捅肛门和嗓子之苦
