12/12/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 23: A lawyer who shares the same floor with Paul Hastings LLP told us that Luc was a total villain who tried to avoid the law to enrich himself by some means in his work. And if anyone dares to speak against Paul Hastings, they will target and track those individuals.

12/12/2022 对邪恶说不 第23天：一位与普衡同处一层办公楼的律师告诉我们，卢克是个十足的恶人，他在工作中会通过一些手段设法绕开法律去敛财。而如果有人胆敢对普衡有微辞，他们会针对并追踪这些人。
