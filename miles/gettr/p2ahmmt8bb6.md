3/4/2023 Miles Guo's GETTR: The New Federal State of China has won the respect of the world at CPAC and western elites are more willing to collaborate with us than ever; the CCP is playing the “Reform and opening-up” trick again, attempting to lure western investment back to Communist China. Will the western politicians and corporations fall for it one more time?
