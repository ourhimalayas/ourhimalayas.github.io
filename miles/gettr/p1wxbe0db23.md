2022.11.04 Mark my words today. If less than 5000 Shanghai people died. You could always (doubt me and) spit on me. 
Are you aware of the basements in Foxconn factory？Do you know how many people died in Foxconn basements? (CCP only allows you to know the tip of iceberg, the real death toll is shocking in Foxconn during Covid lockdown)
（无LOGO版）记住我今天告诉你的，上海隔离期间，如果死的低于5000人，郭文贵你们永远吐弃，
富士康地下室你知道吗？地下室死多少人，你知道吗？
