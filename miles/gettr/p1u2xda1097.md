2022.10.12 The CCP arrested many so-called “disruptive personnel” before the Party’s 20th National Congress. What they did was nothing more than browsing some overseas information via VPN, or having expressed some kind of ideas or suggestions previously.
中共在二十大前抓了很多所谓的不稳定分子，这些人不过是翻墙看了一些海外的信息，或者表达过一些想法和建议。
