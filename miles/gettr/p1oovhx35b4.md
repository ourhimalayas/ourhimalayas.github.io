前羽毛球世界冠军#叶钊颖 被迫在奥运会半决赛 #让球，尽管她在国家队一直占据着女单一号的位置，但为了所谓的 #国家利益，她的最后一次站在奥运会冠军领奖台的机会被无情抹杀。

Former badminton world champion #Ye #Zhaoying was ordered to concede in the Olympic semi-final. Although she had been ranked No. 1 in women's singles nation-wide, it was her last chance to stand on the Olympic winner’s podium.  Ye was mercilessly asked to give it up for the so-called national interest.
