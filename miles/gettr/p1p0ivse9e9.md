2022.08.30 Miles Guo: The CCP kleptocrats stockpiled humongous amount of precious metals through which they gained the power to easily manipulate the market of precious metals. 
Hundreds of tons of silver; 30,000 tons of gold and huge amount of industrial copper;
They are also a major holder of bitcoin.
Many from the British government realized that the CCP Kleptocrats’ true family wealth hidden in Europe is far beyond what they imagined.

共产党家族囤积贵重金属足以左右贵金属市场。几百吨的白银、三万吨的黄金和大量工业用铜。他们同时也是比特币的主要持有者；英国政府很多人发现共产党盗国贼家族藏在欧洲的财富远远超过他们的想象。
