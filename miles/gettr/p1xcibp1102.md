2022.11.08 During the entire visit of Scholz, everybody in Scholz's team including himself have found that China has gone back to 1960s and 1970s, which is similar to the situation in North Korea. Scholz was quite hocked. All the policies deployed by German government in the past have completely failed. 
（无LOGO版）在10个小时52分钟的整个在中国的进出访问当中，所有参与的人，包括舒尔兹本人知道，中国真正的回到了北朝鲜的时代。苏尔茨傻眼了，就德国过去几十年的政策，绝对是完了。
