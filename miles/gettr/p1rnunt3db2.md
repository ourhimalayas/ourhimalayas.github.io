2022.09.21 Mr. Miles GUO told the U.S. and Europe back in 2017 that the darkness would be falling upon the world.  Due to the fact that some Western key stakeholders are complicit with the CCP, on top of the internal political struggles, bureaucratic and systemic flaws in the West, Mr. Guo's voice has not been taken seriously; he has instead become the person who is the most attacked, hacked and smeared against on social media in the world.                      
（无LOGO版）郭文贵先生早在2017就告诉美国和欧洲，黑暗即将到来。但是因为西方的内部政治争斗、官僚、制度缺陷，以及同CCP同流合污的人的存在等原因，郭先生的真实声音并未引起重视，反而成为在社交媒体上被攻击、黑客和造谣的全球第一人。
