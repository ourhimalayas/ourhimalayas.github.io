2023.01.05 A fellow fighter who works at the CCP’s Embassy in an African country has received  orders from the CCP to not allow the receiving State to announce the refusal of Chinese nationals’ travel to this country. The CCP tried to threaten the president of the receiving State with its rogue ways and failed.
我们一个在中共驻非洲某国的海外大使馆工作的战友接到中共命令，不允许驻在国公布不同意中国人到该国旅游，中共甚至又使出了惯用的流氓无赖手段威胁该国总统，遭到总统的断然拒绝。
