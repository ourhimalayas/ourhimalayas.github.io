2022.11.18  At the G20 Summit where world leaders gathered, Xi Jinping made it clear that he would continue to use the Asia-Pacific supply chain to threaten the West. He deemed Taiwan is a domestic affair that other countries shouldn't get involved in. After the G20 and the APEC, Xi Jinping became even more resolute in attacking Taiwan.

习近平在G20这场全世界领导人聚集的峰会上，挑明了态度，要继续用亚太的供应链来威胁西方，并且说台湾是内政问题，各国管不着。这次G20和APEC开完会之后，习近平更加会打台湾了。
