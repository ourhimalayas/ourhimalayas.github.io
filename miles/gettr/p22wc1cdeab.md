12/23/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 34: A so-called detective not only took close up shots of the protesting fellow fighters, but even deliberately drove his car into Nick. All the evidence has been handed over to our lawyers and will be decided by the judge.

12/23/2022 对邪恶说不 第34天：一位所谓的侦探的人不仅近距离拍摄抗议战友们的近景，甚至蓄意开车撞到Nick战友的身上，所有证据已经交给律师，并会由法官作出裁决。
