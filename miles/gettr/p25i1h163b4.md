These American musicians have been suppressed by the mainstream media and blocked by censorship; they share the love of life and the courage to say "no" in the face of injustice with the New Ferderal State of China.

Topher, DVS7.0, and Jimmy Levy love the Chinese people, love peace, and believe that truth is eternal. They are absolute supporters of the NFSC; in this war of tradition, faith, children, and home, we are united in a determined, fearless, and courageous fight against dictatorship and power to rebuild human civilization and faith.

Topher, US Air Force vet, 23x Billboard Charting Artist,  an independent American Christian Conservative rapper, songwriter and conservative commentator.
