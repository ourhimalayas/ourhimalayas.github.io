2022.09.06 The U.S. government has now started questioning the Facebook. The two political parties will both go against Zuckerberg. Twitter, Google and YouTube are included as well. Tik Tok and Zoom will be wiped out. Technology decoupling will shut down Tik Tok and Zoom chips’ access to all the internets. When Zoom and Tik Tok are found to be stealing the information from the U.S., the U.S. will hunt them down and bring them to justice.

现在美国政府已经开始折腾脸书, 接下来美国两党都会反对脸书, 推特, 谷歌和油管。抖音和Zoom一定会被消灭。科技脱钩一定把抖音和Zoom的芯片网络使用权干掉。当Zoom和抖音被查出来偷盗美国信息, 美国一定会穷追不舍。
