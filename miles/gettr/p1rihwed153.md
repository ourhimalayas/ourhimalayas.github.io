2022.09.20 The two heads of state, Putin and Xi Jinping, want to create new Nazism through personal liaisons to rule the world. They cannot represent the people of Russia and China who are entitled to the pursuit of basic human rights. Putin and Xi do not represent justice.
（无LOGO版）普大帝和习近平两国元首，想要通过私人关系，联手打造管理全球的新纳粹主义！他们不能代表俄罗斯和中国人民，两国人民享有追求基本人权。普和习不能代表正义！
