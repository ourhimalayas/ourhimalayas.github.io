2022.09.14 The CCP’s isolation and Covid-zero policies have decimated the fundamental family ties which is the foundation for survival that the Chinese people depended upon, in other words it has destroyed the Chinese families. The COVID-19 pandemic, failed vaccination program, and the legislated decoupling by the US will remove the last chance of survival of the CCP regime. 
共产党的隔离清零政策切断了中国社会赖以生存的家庭基因，毁了中国的家庭。现在的国内的病毒疫苗加上美国的立法脱钩，共产党已经没有生存的余地的。
