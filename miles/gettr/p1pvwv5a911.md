2022.09.06 In the earthquakes in Sichuan, the CCP did not value the lives of the mountain residents.  They were not forewarned to leave the mountainous areas before the earthquakes.  The CCP simply saw the Sichuan people as slaves who provide the rare produce from the mountains for the enjoyment of the CCP cadres. The next earthquake will span the entire Chinese economy and finance.  The CCP is expecting the demise of several millions of people, and they are doing nothing to stop it.
中国四川地震，中共视山区百姓生命如草芥，不提前劝离山区，仅为了给中南坑吃山珍。接下来会发生的地震在全中国，是中国的经济 金融，中共期盼着多死几百万人。
