2022.09.06 Three phases of the U.S. technology decoupling with CCP:
The first phase is that the U.S. will not sell CCP chip products, industrial chips and advanced chips, the EDA and the discontinuation of associated hardware supply.
The second phase is the U.S. will require U.S. technology companies to immediately withdraw from CCP China.
The third phase will be in the form of financial punishment and legal constraints, which are real sanctions and true decoupling.

美中技术脱钩三步曲:
第一步是美国不出售中共芯片产品, 工业芯片和高级芯片、EDA以及中断硬件供应。
第二步是完全撤离, 即美国要求本国科技公司立即撤离中共。
第三步是经济惩罚和法律约束, 是真正制裁、真正脱钩。
