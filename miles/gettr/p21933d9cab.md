12/08/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 19: The Chinese Communist Party and its lackeys' oppression and unrestricted legal warfare against the Whistleblowers' movement and fellow fighters is a challenge to all the Chinese and we have to use our right of free speech to defend our rights.

12/08/2022 对邪恶说不 第19天：中共及其走狗对爆料革命战友进行压迫和法律超限战，就是对所有中国人的挑战，我们要利用言论自由的权利来捍卫我们的权利。
