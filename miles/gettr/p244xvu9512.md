2023.01.06 White Paper Revolution is really a Women's White Paper Revolution.  A friend in Lanzhou said thousands of corps were dumped in the Yellow River and so many wolves, wild dogs and foxes were eating the corpses in Lanzhou area, how many corpses would be in entire China? There were fireworks started all over the country, the authorities want to stop it at all costs.
白纸运动是女白纸运动，兰州战友爆料，当地数千具尸体被扔到黄河，黄河两边未曾见过的大量狼、野狗、狐狸出没撕咬尸体，此情况综观全国，不知有多少百姓尸体。自南京杭州开始，几个小时内全国燃起烟火、四处发生冲突，上层政府不顾人命，只想搞灭烟火。
