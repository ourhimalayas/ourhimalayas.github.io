2022.11.28 A state of emergency and martial law will probably be declared for the first time since June 4, 1989. The situation will be very serious and we will stand with all our domestic fellow fighters. We must defeat the Chinese Communist Party. Fellow fighters must be wise. Be sure to protect yourselves properly.
九六四之后, 可能会首次宣布紧急状态、戒严令。情况会非常严峻。我们会与所有国内战友们站在一起。打倒共产党。战友要有智慧，一定要保重好自己。
