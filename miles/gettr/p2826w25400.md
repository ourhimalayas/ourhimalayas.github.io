2/11/2023 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The balloon incident the U.S. disclosed to the public is not the whole story,  and more shocking truth will be exposed in the future. The balloon incident is just the beginning of the CCP's entire plan. Communist China will carry out a series of actions that are even more frenzied. The CCP is awaiting the collapse of the Western and American economies, and then will see an opportunity to deal a fatal blow. The CCP’s final goal is to defeat the U.S. and the West through unrestricted and asymmetric warfare.
