10/13/2022 Miles Guo:  Even though the U.S. and the West are stepping up their supervision on digital currencies, it won’t help prevent the economic collapse from happening; after the digital currency has become a stable currency with solid value and the CCP has been ended, whoever can resume China’s financial order and the economic standings of Hong Kong and Taiwan in the world, who will be the savior of the world; Russians are pessimistic about the RMB settlement; we hope that the CCP is taken down through non-war means to save as many lives as possible

10/13/2022 文贵盖特：即使美国和西方将对数字货币加大监管也难避免经济崩塌；在数字货币真正成为稳定有价值的货币以及中共灭亡后，谁能恢复中国的金融秩序，恢复香港和台湾在世界的经济地位，谁才是世界的救星；俄罗斯人不看好人民币结算；我们希望中共灭亡是通过非战争手段，以尽可能多地保护生命
