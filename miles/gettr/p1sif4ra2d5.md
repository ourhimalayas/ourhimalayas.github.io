2022.09.28 The CCP’s reopening the train-freight from north-east Dandong of China to North Korea’s Sinuiju-si is to show it still has some “friends”. It is normal that Chinese-Russian naval formations were spotted crossing the Bering Strait. The CCP and Russia have started this practice since 2006, when XI “the Sun” (Jinping) came into power.
（无LOGO版）中共重新开通东北丹东到朝鲜的货运列车是想表明它还有“朋友”。中俄海军编队被发现穿越白令海峡很正常，从2006年习太阳上来的时候就开始了。
