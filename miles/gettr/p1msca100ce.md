8/15/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Blockchain ledger technology will soon be adopted around the world; there might be implementation of adverse laws attempting to discourage the use of digital currencies, but all those efforts will fail and the advent of blockchain technology is unstoppable; the EDA restrictions fired the first shot in the technology decoupling from the CCP. Next the financial information, statistics and all secrets of the CCP will be exposed to the world.

8/15/2022 文贵盖特：区块链记账技术一定会很快在全球普及；各国对数字货币可能会立法打击，但终不敌区块链时代的到来；EDA打响了与中共科技脱钩的第一枪，接下来中共的金融、统计和所有秘密都将曝光于天下。
