11/27/2022 Say No to Evil: Speaking the truth in a Communist China would risk your life, but in the United States, the police support and agree with our protests. Freedom is not free, and we will keep fighting against these dark forces in the United States that collaborate with the Chinese Communist Party.

11/27/2022 对邪恶说不：在中共国讲出真话会有性命之忧，但在美国，警察支持并赞同我们的抗议。自由不是免费的，我们会坚持与美国这些与中共勾结的黑暗势力作斗争。
