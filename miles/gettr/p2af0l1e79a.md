【NFSC @CPAC 】03/02/2023 Mr. Horace Cooper, Co-Chairman of Project 21 said that the United States must stop its policy of appeasement because it has greatly contributed to the enrichment of the Chinese Communist Party, and the consequence of enriching them is that instead of thanking the United States, the Communist Party has used one deal after another to increase its national power, ultimately threatening the national security of the United States.

【新中国联邦DC星火行动】03/02/2023 21号项目的联合主席贺拉斯•库珀先生认为，美国必须停止绥靖政策，因为这大大助长了中国共产党的富强，而让它们富裕起来的后果是，中共不仅不感谢美国，反而利用一次次交易增强国力，最终威胁到了美国的国家安全。
