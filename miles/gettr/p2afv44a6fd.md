【NFSC @CPAC 】03/03/2023 To Nicole's question about whether EU should start decoupling Europe completely from the CCP, economically, financially, diplomatically and on many levels, Vice President of the European Conservatives and Reformists parliamentary group (ECR) Hermann Tertsch @hermanntertsch  answers that the EU has started the decoupling. And that is the report of the European Union that was issued last year, and it was approved by an enormous majority. We have decided to decouple from the tyranny and from the agents of the tyranny.
