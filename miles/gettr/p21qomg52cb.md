12/13/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 24: Although some fellow fighters on our protest frontline are sick, we don’t have to worry as other fellow fighters have already brought them medicines and nourishment in the first place. The care and love for each other have touched our fellow fighters and will encourage us to keep on fighting!
