01/10/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL, fellow fighters in Japan were protesting against CCP in front of Paul Hastings office building at Roppongi, Tokyo and exposing the infiltration of CCP. Black Cat talked about Heita Kawakatsu, the governor of Shizuoka Prefecture, who had been awarded and reported by CCP for many times. He was super proud of being received by dictator Xi Jinping and did lots of thing for CCP, so it is important to stand up to expose the truth.
