【NFSC @CPAC 】03/02/2023 Legislator District 4 in New York, Ben Geller: One month ago, both the Democratic and Republican caucuses voted unanimously at Congress to condemn the CCP’s brutality in China. That's a front that the American citizens and the United States government can get behind. Both the House and the Senate would be inclined to accept the NFSC as a force against the CCP.

【新中国联邦DC星火行动】03/02/2023 纽约第四区议员Ben Geller: 刚好一个月前，民主党和共和党核心小组在国会一致投票通过，谴责中共在中共国的暴行。这一战线会获得美国民众和美国政府的共同支持。参众两院都倾向于接受新中国联邦作为一股反共的力量。
