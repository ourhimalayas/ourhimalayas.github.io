01/03/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 45: We came to the house of Luc Despins' younger daughter to protest, just to let the neighborhood and his daughter know that the money she received from her dad was the hard-earned money of the Chinese people that Luc got through collusion with the Chinese Communist Party, which is very disgraceful.

01/03/2023 对邪恶说不 第45天：我们来到卢克·德斯宾斯二女儿的住所抗议，就是要让周围的邻居和他女儿知道，她从她爸爸那里拿到的钱是卢克与中共勾结得来的中国人民的血汗钱，这是非常可耻的事情。
