8/20/2022  Miles Guo’s GETTR: My live streaming a couple of days ago really stirred the pot in Communist China. Many celebrities, government officials, and those who have long forgotten me or have made a clear break with me all found a way to get in touch with me, attempting to stop me from blowing the whistle on them. However, they fail to understand that I want nothing from them. The only thing I am all in is to take down the CCP. They are welcome to side with me to end the CCP, other than that, nothing else will interest me.

8/20/2022  文贵盖特： 我前两天的直播影响很大，许多明星、官员，还有早已忘记我以及和我划清界限的人都来找我说情。但他们没有认识到，我对他们无任何所求，我要做的就是灭共，他们也可以和我站在一起灭共，其他免谈！
