2022.11.21 In the past 11 months, millions of companies went to bankrupt, and about 0.2 billion people lost their jobs. The domestic supply chain in China has been broken. Once the supply chain in China is broken, the supply chain worldwide will have to re-organize. The overall supply chain in the world may have significant issues.
中国就过去短短的11个月，几百万家企业倒闭， 2亿人失业。中国的供应链的基石已经彻底被打破，全世界的供应链的重整。整个这个就全世界的供应链，一切都将出现大问题。
