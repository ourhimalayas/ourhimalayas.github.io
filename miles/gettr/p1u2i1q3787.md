10/12/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP instigated the regional conflicts in an attempt to alleviate the US pressure on the Russia-Ukraine war and to divert the West's attention from the CCP. Xi has embarked on militarism by risking everything. This is extremely stupid and dangerous and will lead the US and the West to pass their economic crises on to the CCP, and there will be an extremely dangerous nationalist ideology and a mixture of civil and external wars in Communist China, which will eventually get out of control. The population of China will be reduced to 300-400 million.
