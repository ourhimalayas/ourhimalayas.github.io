11/27/2022 Miles Guo: The over 40 people burned to death in Urumqi are the price the Chinese must pay for their ignorance and selfishness. The entire two floors of the Marriott Hotel in Saudi, where Xi Jinping will be staying, were demolished. Xi’s Saudi trip is equipped with two kitchens and four military aircraft carrying food. In contrast, the Chinese are living such a pathetic life!

11/27/2022 文贵直播：乌鲁木齐被烧死的40多人是中国人为其无知、自私必然要付出的代价；习近平将入驻的沙特万豪酒店整整两层被拆，配备2个厨房及4架军机运送食品；相比之下，中国人活得太可怜了！
