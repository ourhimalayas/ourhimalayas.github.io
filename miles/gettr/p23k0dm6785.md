12/30/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 41: Our protest in front of Luc Despins' house has changed the attitude of Luc's neighbors towards us. In fact, they have long known that the CCP is evil, and now they also understand that Luc and Paul Hastings are traitors to the United States.

12/30/2022 对邪恶说不 第41天：我们在卢克家门前的抗议改变了卢克邻居对我们的态度。 他们其实早就知道中共是邪恶的，现在也明白卢克和普衡是卖美贼了。
