2022.12.16 The quarantine camps in China become the origin of outbreaks. Xi Jinping was tested positive for COVID-19 so he figured the whole population should get a taste of it too. WHO has secretly notified CCP that the announcement of the end of the global pandemic is pending. In order to not be isolated from the international community, CCP eased the lockdown and the outbreaks aggravated. It is clear to Xi now that all the outbreaks are actually because of the mass vaccination. It is sad though to see Chinese people lining up to buy Lianhua Qingwen capsules, a medicine that doesn't help at all!
国内疫情爆发，方舱成了传染源。习近平被传染他觉得那全国人民都阳一下又何如。世卫已密报共产党马上要宣布全球疫情结束。由于不想被孤立共产党不得不解封导致传染加剧。习已清楚疫情四起是疫苗反应。国人排队购买没用的莲花清瘟实属可悲。
