2022.08.26 Although the VPNs were all blocked in China, it didn’t stop our propagation. Chinese would definitely watch the livestream many times. Miles also mentioned that there were many people from financial field who tried to convince him stop doing so just for the two celebrities. Lives of ordinary people in China literally worth nothing.
虽然 VPN 在中国都被封锁了，但它并没有阻止我们的传播。 中国人肯定会多次观看直播。 Miles还提到，有很多金融界人士试图说服他停止爆料。 在中国，普通人的生命一文不值。
