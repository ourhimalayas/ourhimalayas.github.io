“The Third Warfare: Chinese Lawfare And Antisemitism” by Kelly Walker. The article discussed CCP’s legal warfare in additon to public opinion warfare, psychological warfare to weaken America and “persecute Chinese dissidents on American soil”. It questioned U.S. law firms for “representing the interests of the CCP”. It mentioned Jewish-American lawyer Elliot Dordick’s ethics complaint against Paul Hastings LLP and Luc Despins for repeatedly citing “a notoriously antisemitic, racist, anti-immigrant website in federal court to attack a Chinese dissident” in Mr. Miles Guo’s bankruptcy case. It also mentioned that freedom-loving NFSC people are taking down the CCP.
