02/11/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 84: An American policeman said to the NFSC protesters that the CCP wants to turn the United States, and even the whole world, into a communist country, and he does not want his children to receive communist education at school. Other passers-by, including the police, are very supportive of our anti-CCP protest and chant our slogan “Take Down the CCP!”
