2022.08.31 The financial and currency wars have already begun. XI Jinping holds the military power. Xi wants to eliminate Zeng Qinghong, Meng Jianzhu and Wang Qishan, first from overseas. After the 20th Congress, many wars will be stoked in the Middle East, including terrorist attacks, and this will force the US into a quagmire. The CCP will use the US financial and stock market crisis to speed up the internationalization of the RMB. The CCP will invade Taiwan. We have the Whistleblower's Movement, and the Chinese Communist Party will definitely be over by 2025.

金融，货币大战已经开始. 习掌握着军权. 习要把曾庆红，孟建柱，王岐山消灭，先从海外解决；二十大后，在中东的大量战争，包括恐怖袭击会把美国带入泥坑. 同时利用美国金融和股市危机加快人民币国际化. 一定打台湾. 但有我们爆料革命, 共产党在2025年肯定结束。
