11/28/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL: One courageous Chinese woman asked our fellow fighters for a lot of flyers and said that she would share the information at the rally in solidarity with the protests across China. An American who had dinner with Xi Jinping three years ago sensed Xi's ambitions back then and is now supportive of the protests launched by the fellow fighters.

11/28/2022 对邪恶说不：一位勇敢的华人女性找战友要了大量传单并称将把信息分享给一个声援中国各地抗议的集会；一位三年前和习近平共进晚餐的美国人当时就感受到了习的野心，而他现在很支持战友们的抗议
