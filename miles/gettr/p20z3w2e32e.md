2022.12.07 After its third generation, the CCP has turned into Xi’s Party. Xi considers the ‘White Paper’ movement as an existential threat to CCP’s survival. As result, 25,000 people have been arrested nationwide. Insofar the US has not successfully predicted any of CCP policies. Xi has sworn that after his Saudi visit, he will start showing some muscle to the West.
共产党从第三代就过渡到了习家党。习近平认为白纸运动事关共产党的生死存亡，现在已经抓了25000人。对中国共产党的政治没有一件事美国猜明白的。习近平放狠话，等沙特之后再给西方点儿颜色看看。
