【NFSC @CPAC 】03/03/2023 Pete Hoekstra, the former US Ambassador to the Netherlands, has spoken out about the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming that the virus originated from a CCP lab and the CCP facilitated its spread around the world. He further criticized the American government's handling of the situation, alleging that the intelligence community was complicit in silencing voices that suggested the virus came from the lab, and instead promoting a political narrative that protected the CCP and damaged America.
