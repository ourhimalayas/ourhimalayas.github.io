How could Paul Hastings LLP possibly claim it properly oversees its attorneys if they lend credibility to sources of hatred in federal court? 

I'm stunned to see this coming from attorneys at such a prestigious firm. I took it upon myself to file the ethics complaint you see attached to these posts immediately upon discovering their actions, and I hope they all face significant consequences.

This legitimization of such an outrageous source has no place in our courtrooms.
