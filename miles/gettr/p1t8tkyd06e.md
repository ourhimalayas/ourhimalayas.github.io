2022.10.05 Miles Guo mentioned earlier on, Fatty Kim firing ballistic missile are all part of the plan of Xi-Putin.  It is to threaten Japan so that it does not get too close to the US.  Dictators like Xi The Sun and Putin the Czar are actually very fearful of death.  They will not risk deploying the ultimate weaponry.
