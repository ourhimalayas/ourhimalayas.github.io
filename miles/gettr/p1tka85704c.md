2022.10.08 Credit Suisse has been dealing with Chinese government officials since the Qing Dynasty. Politically influential families from Kuomintang also have a lot of wealth in Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse does not give weight to who the ruling party is. They consider the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) just as Chinese people. UBS, on the other hand, specializes in helping the CCP officials to launder money, conceal money and forge documents. Credit Suisse will not fail for the time being, but in the process of restructuring, many hidden things of the CCP will be exposed.
（无LOGO版）瑞信从清朝就与中国政府官员打交道，国民党几大家族的钱很多都在瑞信，瑞信他不分执政党派是谁，他们认为中国共产党就是中国人。而瑞银UBS专门帮共产党官员洗钱、藏钱、作假票据。瑞信暂时还不会倒，但是重整的过程中，共产党很多隐藏的东西都会暴露出来。
