10/16/2022 Miles Guo: Xi Jinping did not designate us as the anti-CCP treason group of Miles Guo and the New Federal State of China (NFSC) in his direct instructions until recently. Xi’s so-called “national security” means that he worries that the CCP will be overthrown, while his mentioning of “political security” shows his fear of the efforts of the NFSC and the Whistleblowers’ Movement to take down the CCP rather than the internal fight. Xi’s fear of us goes beyond anything you can imagine.

10/16/2022 文贵直播：直到最近，习近平才在直接批示中将我们界定为“郭文贵和新中国联邦的反党叛国团伙”；习所谓”国家安全“指担心中共被推翻，“政治安全”则是怕新中国联邦、爆料革命灭共而非中共内斗。习对咱们的恐惧超乎想象！
