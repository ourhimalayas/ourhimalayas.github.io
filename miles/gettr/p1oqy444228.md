8/28/2022 Miles Guo: The Kleptocrats were worried that the Americans would find out about the money they had hidden in digital currencies, so they began to purchase large quantities of precious metals and store them in secret locations. This indicates that they are aware that the CCP is going to be finished! This is just like what the Baylors did at the end of the Qing Dynasty - they deposited their money in foreign banks, and that eventually led to the downfall of the Qing Dynasty.

8/28/2022 文贵直播：盗国贼们担心美国人找到他们藏在数字货币中的钱，所以他们大量地把数字货币提现，买入贵重金属并藏了起来，这说明他们知道中共要完蛋了！这和清朝末期贝勒王爷们把钱存进外国银行，并最终导致清朝灭亡的做法如出一辙
