2022.10.13 It is just to toss Wang Qishan around by all means and prohibit him from decision-making. He is excluded from any internal affairs. This means that Wang Qishan has become a display already far away from the center of power and decision making. This "senior sensible man" of the CCP is very tragic. There is no more to tell. I said long ago that Wang Qishan has lost half of his freedom already.
（无LOGO版）反正就折腾王岐山呗，反正也不会让你这么议事啊，多大的事也不会让你议啊，说明王岐山已经远远早就成了摆设，远离了权力决策中心，这个共产党的“大明白人”很惨，没有什么背后故事了，七哥早就说过，他一半已经失去自由了。
