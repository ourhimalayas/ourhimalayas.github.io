8/28/2022 Miles Guo: The demise of Russia is a foregone conclusion after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, and the CCP will be the next one to be finished. Russia's expansion of its military indicates that the US has gained victory. The collapse of the former Soviet Union will repeat itself in Russia, and this event will also spread to Communist China. There is bound to be rebellions inside the CCP!

8/28/2022 文贵直播：俄乌战争后，俄罗斯的消失已成定局，下一个完蛋的就是中共！俄罗斯扩军说明美国赢了，而苏联解体的一幕必将在俄罗斯重演，这一幕也必将传到中共国，共产党内部一定会造反！
