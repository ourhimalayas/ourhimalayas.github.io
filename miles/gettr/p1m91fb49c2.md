8/11/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR:  A report about me cited by ZeroHedge has received so much attention from a certain department of a country. This article was actually written by the CCP and then was fed to a foreign journalist who works for the CCP to publish, and ZeroHedge then cited the whole article. The CCP and its accomplices in the West are trying to defeat me through two ways: one is to make me conduct contempt of court, the other is to set me up for bankruptcy fraud.  The report coming out at this time is indeed serving those evil purposes

8/11/2022 文贵盖特：零对冲近日转载的一篇关于我的报道引起某国某部门高度警惕，该文实为中共所写，然后交由为中共服务的外媒记者发表，并由零对冲转发。中共及其国外打手企图通过两招来对付我，一是让我藐视法庭，二是让我破产欺诈，该文此时发表就是服务于这些目的
