8/17/2022 Miles Guo: Zeng Wei has a teahouse in the basement of the US United Apartment building near the East 3rd Ring in Beijing, and was called the "Small Zhongnanhai". Yao Qing also has several similar teahouses; for the CCP Princelings, the teahouse is a place for the police and gangsters to make deals, for the CCP officials to trade money for power and sex with celebrities!

8/17/2022 文贵直播：曾维在北京东三环的US联邦公寓地下室有一个茶室，号称小中南海，姚庆也有几个类似的茶室；对于这些太子党来说，茶室就是警察与黑道做交易，当官的做钱权交易，和明星们做性交易的场所！
