10/9/2022 Miles Guo: The western world’s perception of Communist China is based on the reasoning of a normal person, which is: I will be safe only when you are safe. However, the thought of the CCP is just the opposite: I will be safe only when you are NOT safe. That’s why the West made the wrong judgment regarding whether the CCP will invade Taiwan or not. Only we, the New Federal State of China, truly understand the CCP and the thoughts of “Xi the Sun”!

10/9/2022 文贵直播：西方对中共国的理解是出于正常人互惠互利的思维，然而在中共眼里，只有你不安全，我才可能安全，这就是为什么西方在中共是否会攻打台湾的问题上做出误判，只有新中国联邦才真正了解共产党和习太阳的内心世界！
