2/14/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL, fellow fighter Black Cat talked about well-known Japanese semiconductor manufacture, Murata Manufacturing. It didn’t withdraw from China after the Sino-US trade war, even though Japanese government provided subsidies to help companies moving out of China. On the contrary, Murata Manufacturing made the largest investment in its history in China last year, 45 billion yen and lost 140 billion yen by the end of last year. This is the consequence when they don't look at the trend of world history and continue to collude with the CCP.

02/14/2023 对邪恶说不，黑猫战友谈到了日本著名的半导体制造企业村田制作所，在美中贸易战后，日本政府对日企进行补贴帮助他们退出中共国，村田也没有退出。相反，去年在中共国做了450亿日元其史上最大投资，然而去年共计损失1400亿日元。这就是他们不看世界历史趋势，继续与中共勾结的后果。
