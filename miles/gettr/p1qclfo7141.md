9/9/2022 Miles Guo: Xi Jinping and Peng Liyuan had prepared for over a year to get ready for visiting Queen Elizabeth II, and they paid 5 billion GBP for just a 20-30 minutes ride in the Queen's royal carriage. Wang Huning was too excited to fall asleep the night prior to seeing the Queen. Queen Elizabeth II is loved by her people because she protects her own people, while Chinese emperors rise to the throne at the cost of Lao Baixing's lives!

9/9/2022 文贵直播：习近平和彭丽媛为了见英国女王精心准备了一年多，花了50亿英镑就为坐一下女王的金马车，王沪宁见女王的前一夜激动得彻夜未眠；英女王受爱戴是因为她保护自己的国民，而中国的皇帝是踩着老百姓的尸体获得的皇位
