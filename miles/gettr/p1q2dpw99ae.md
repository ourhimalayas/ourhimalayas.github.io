9/7/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP has fired the first shot of the world financial and currency war! The West has truly felt the threats from Russia's energy cutoff. Russia sold natural gas to Europe with the CCP being the middleman and thus obtained foreign exchange. Iran not only has profited a lot by selling oil and gas, but also provided Russia with weapons. Russia is a big winner in terms of threatening the European energy supplies despite that it has lost in every other respect.

9/7/2022 文贵直播：中共已打响了世界金融货币大战的第一枪！西方真正感受到了俄罗斯的能源威胁。俄罗斯通过中共卖天然气给欧洲并获得了外汇，伊朗不仅通过卖油气大赚并给俄罗斯提供武器支持；俄罗斯虽在其他方面都输了，但在对欧洲的能源威胁上却成了大赢家
