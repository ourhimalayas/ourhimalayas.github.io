12/4/2022 Miles Guo: Xi Jinping pointed out during an internal speech that the Zero-COVID quarantine policy can cut the Chinese Lao Baixing’s daily expenses by 80%, and this is called the strategy of “tightening the belt”. By doing so Xi attempts to contest the West with lower living costs, cut the supply chains to the West, mess up the western economy, and ultimately ambush the West and invade Taiwan!

12/4/2022 文贵直播：习近平的内部讲话指出，隔离清零政策让中国老百姓每天节省80%的开支，这叫勒紧裤腰带政策，旨在和西方拼低生活成本，断掉西方的供应链，搞乱西方经济，最终对西方发动袭击并入侵台湾!
