9/4/2022 Miles Guo：The U.S. wants to see Communist China becoming another Iran so it won't impose any threat to the U.S.. However, the Chinese people and their next generation will have to pay the huge price for that outcome. If the CCP's ruling over China was altered, the U.S. would have two concerns: whether there would be chaos in China, and who would govern China. Communist China will lose twice in the economic field: one is American businesses moving out of China, and the other is China losing the market in Southeast Asia

9/4/2022 文贵直播：美国最希望中共国变成伊朗，这样对美国不产生任何威胁，而中国至少两代人会为此付出惨重代价；但如果中共执政的现状被改变，美国则担心中国是否会大乱，且谁会接替执政中国；中共国在经济上会输两次，第一次是美国企业的撤出，第二次是输掉东南亚市场。
