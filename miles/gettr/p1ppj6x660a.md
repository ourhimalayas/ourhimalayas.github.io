9/4/2022 Miles Guo: "Win-win cooperation" is what Xi Jinping will mention the most when he travels abroad in the future. The essence of "win-win cooperation" is that the global ruling class cooperates to rule over the slaves of all humanity. The CCP will keep implementing its Zero-COVID policy and spread it to the world. The number of positive cases in Communist China is all up to the CCP. If the CCP claims there are positive cases, then the cases will be reported regardless of whether or not they really caught the virus. Xi's pushing the Zero-COVID policy follows the mantle of Mao Zedong's core idea of guerrilla warfare.
