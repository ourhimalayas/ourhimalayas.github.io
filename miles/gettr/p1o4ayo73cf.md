The past decade is Xi's political struggle to be the real leader instead of the puppet whom he was supposed to be. Wang Qishan, Meng Jianzhu, Zeng Qinghong, and the Jiang family seek to destroy the Communist Youth League faction, control China’s economy, and eliminate those who betrayed them such as Xi Jinping and Li Zhanshu. There have been casualties on both sides while killing each other.
