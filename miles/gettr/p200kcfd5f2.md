11/28/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The CCP has defined the anti-lockdown protests as “Color Revolution”. Tens of thousands of special police have been deployed to Beijing and Shanghai, and martial law might be declared soon in the two cities. Cutting-off of water, electricity, gas supplies and communications will become a norm in Communist China!
