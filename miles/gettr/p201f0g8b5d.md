11/28/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL，NaNa, a NFSC fellow fighter from Himalaya Washington DC Farm joined the protest against Paul Hastings Law Firm in Tokyo, Japan. Because Paul Hastings has colluded with the CCP to steal the pensions of the Americans, NaNa fears that her future pensions will be stolen by the CCP in this way, so she hopes the Japanese government and nationals will be concerned about this matter. Because the blood money of the Chinese people in mainland China was also stolen by the CCP, she feels she has the obligation to stand up and speak out.

11/28/2022对邪恶说不，来自新中国联邦美国华盛顿DC农场的战友娜娜，也参加了在日本东京的抗议普衡律师事务所的活动。因为普衡与中共勾结偷盗了美国老百姓的养老金，娜娜担心她未来的养老金也这样被中共盗取，她希望日本政府和国民关心这件事。因为墙内中国人民的血汉钱也被中共偷盗，她觉得自己有义务站出来发声。
