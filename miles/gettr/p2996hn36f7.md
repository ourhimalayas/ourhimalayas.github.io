02/20/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 93: An old neighbor wished the NFSC protesters good luck when he learned that they are fighting both for the Chinese people and American people. He said:”Thank you, Thank you, God bless you, I wish everything is going to be OKAY and finish your mission”. When the NFSC fellow fighters talk about CCP and communism, all the neighbors become highly nervous because they don’t want this country to turn into a Communist country

02/20/2023 对邪恶说不 第93天：一位年长的附近居民当得知新中国联邦的抗议战友是在为中美人民而战时，祝愿我们好运。他说：“非常感谢你们，祝你们一切顺利，祝你们的使命也成功”。当新中国联邦的战友说到中共和共产主义的时候，大家脑袋弦都绷起来了，因为他们不希望这个国家变成共产主义。
