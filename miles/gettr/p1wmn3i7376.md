2022.11.02 Himalaya Exchange faced great suppression from the CCP when applying for licenses in various countries. The CCP put pressure on relevant authorities and threatened to close their banks in China. The Himalaya Exchange Team followed with accurate and detail information, making known the future and possibility of digital currency with goodwill. At the same time, showing the other parties respect and obtainable benefits brought them success.
喜联储在各国申请牌照的时候，受到了中共诸多打压。中共对各国当局施压，威胁要关掉对方银行，但是喜联储的相关团队给了他们更加准确的信息，向对方传达更多的善意，让他们认识数字货币的未来与可能。同时给对方更多的尊重，和更多的可获得的利益，这种情况下，这个事才能成功。
