2022.10.11 As a nation, the Chinese people are ignorant about kindness, politics, international affairs, especially human rights; they are as ignorant as peoples from the Stone Age. The ugliness and ignorance of human character, as well as greed, are mobilized by the CCP again and again, and that’s why we had the Cultural Revolution and the whole country switching between opening and closing. This is how the CCP manipulates public opinion. 
（无LOGO版）中国这个国家，这个人民，他们对善良、政治、国际、特别是人权这块，几乎是无知到了一个石器时代的感觉。人性的丑恶和无知和人性的贪婪一次一次被中共调动，就是文化大革命和整个国家在开放和闭关之间切换。这就是中共如何操弄民意。
