【NFSC@CPAC 】03/02/2023  Active military serviceman Henry Clarke: If China is trying to use economics as a weapon against the United States, you need to start a movement to where we are not buying goods manufactured in China, when you buy products that are manufactured in China, you are supporting that communistic slave state. We should also boycott American companies like Disney and Nike which are using slave labor in Xinjiang 

【新中国联邦DC星火行动】03/02/2023 现役军人亨利·克拉克：如果中共国想把其经济作为武器对付美国，那么我们就需要开展一场不再购买中共国商品的运动。当你还在购买中共国制造的商品，你就是在支持一个共产主义奴隶政权。我们还需要抵制如迪士尼和耐克这样的公司，因为它们正在使用新疆的奴工。
