2022.09.27 The old bastards of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) sent undercover agents to our online H-Coin audit briefing yesterday and demanded many of its departments to study every single second of our meeting minutes its spies have reported back. The CCP needs to learn how to treat people indeed. Those who are promoting righteousness first must be righteous themselves. Getting yourself right before criticizing others. The CCP will soon notice that the New Federal State of China is raising the highest voice in the world, calling on all its citizens to govern and participate in the construction of the rule of law, and the construction of freedom in China.
（无LOGO版）CCP派卧底到我们昨天的核币简报会, 要求很多部门一秒钟不能差都要学习。CCP要好好学习我们怎样善待别人,  正人者先正己; 言人者先看自己。
