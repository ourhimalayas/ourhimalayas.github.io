2022.09.18 Xi “the Sun” (Jinping) was really scared (of what happened in China) and had returned to Beijing earlier than planned. Xi and Putin had reached an agreement that is called the “Scheme of Dragging the Knife” (pretend to be retrieving, deceive the enemies, and suddenly fight back).
Since last week, in China, there are at least about 1600 to 1700 state owned technology enterprises, chip enterprises, and those so-called state owned policy based financial institutes, basically declared their bankruptcy.

习太阳非常害怕（国内发生的事），提前回北京了。习普二人商量好了“拖刀计”。上一周国内最起码有1600-1700个国有控制的科技企业，芯片企业和所谓的国家政策性金融机构。
