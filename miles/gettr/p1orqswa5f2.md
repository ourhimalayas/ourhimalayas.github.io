8/28/2022 Miles Guo: I think within 1,000 days, the grain seeds and the overseas food supplies will be unavailable to Communist China. Although people doubted me when I talked about IBM’s 2nm chips and Starlink, both of them came out as expected. The European and Japanese counterparts of Starlink will be launched, and there will probably be a “New China Link” of the New Federal State of China. The 2nm chips will drastically increase computing power and reduce power consumption. But Communist China won’t have such a technology in 50 years.

8/28/2022 文贵直播: 文贵认为一千天之内，中共国的种子和海外的粮食供给都会归零；尽管以前文贵谈及IBM的2纳米芯片和星链时曾遭人质疑，但两者都如约问世；接下来会出现欧链和日链，甚至会有新中国链；2纳米芯片将大幅提高算力并降低能耗，中共国再过50年也不会有这样的技术
