2022.09.13 The collusion between the International Human Rights Organizations and totalitarian countries has resulted the people of China, Russia, North Korea, Iraq and other countries in losing their human rights and protection for a long time. It also has taken America and the Western world more than 10 years to confront with the hope to bring back the real supervision and fairness of human rights in the International Human Rights Organizations.
国际人权组织与极权国家的勾兑让中俄朝伊等国家的人民长期失去了人权和保护。美国和西方世界也用了十多年的对抗, 希望在国际人权组织中恢复对人权的真正监督和公平。
