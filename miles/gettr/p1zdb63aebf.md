11/21/2022  Miles Guo:  Someone who met Xi at the G20 said to me that people from different countries have always thought that the CCP leaders completely represent China and the Chinese people. However, being influenced by the Whistleblowers’ Movement, people have started to get to know the arrogance, hypocrisy, and bureaucracy of the CCP leaders and officials, and to see through the CCP’s true nature of enslaving the Chinese people.

11/21/2022  文贵直播：在G20上跟习近平见面的人告诉我，世界各国的人一直认为中共国的领导人完全代表着中国和中国人民，但是由于听了爆料革命，他们也逐渐看清了中共领导人和中共官员的狂妄、虚伪、官僚，认清了中共奴役中国人民的本质。
