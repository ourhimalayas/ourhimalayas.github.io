2022.08.25 Miles Guo： The people of the New Federal State of China should be extremely grateful. At this most critical and historical moment in humans, we are a group of people that escaped the Covid jab. And we have our social platform. The Covid vaccine controversy and climate change will bring about a huge moment in human history. It is going to be a historical moment we have never seen before.

郭先生：新中国联邦人真的要感谢在这个最关键的人类的全球的历史时刻，而且我们还有平台。疫苗事件, 还有气候的变化都给人类将带来巨大的，一个完全的不同于以往的历史时刻。
