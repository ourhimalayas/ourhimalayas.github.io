12/19/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL, one of fellow fighters, 88jj shared his story. When an elderly couple came to his restaurant for their birthday celebration, he made a bowl of Chinese ramen for them, and it was touched himself as well. Like all overseas NFSC fellow fighters overseas, 88jj cannot go back to China to visit his parents and make a bowl of ramen for them because of the existence of the CCP. 
12/19/2022 对邪恶说不，88jj 战友分享了他的故事。当一对老夫妇来他的餐厅庆祝生日时，他为他们准备了中国拉面，自己也被感动。因为中共的存在，和所有海外新中国联邦战友一样，88jj不能回国看望父母。
