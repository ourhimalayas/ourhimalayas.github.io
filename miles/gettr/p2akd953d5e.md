【NFSC @CPAC 】03/04/2023 Founder & President of Citizen Media News Roger Farina: I am amazed at the NFSC stuffs and I will look at it and talk about it. The stuffs seem the balloon in the sky and is far away from what’s going on, but when you talk to NFSC and you will learn that all the stuffs are in every aspect of our lives. As an average American, we can go to events like CPAC and conservative party meetings and elect the right people on the leadership positions

【新中国联邦DC星火行动】03/04/2023 Citizen News Media 创始人和主席罗杰·法里纳: 我对新中国联邦的所有事情感到惊奇，我会继续研究并且谈论新中国联邦。这些事情看似离我们实际生活非常遥远，但当你与新中国联邦交谈后就会得知，中共的威胁在我们生活的方方面面。作为普通美国人，我们可以参加如CPAC一样的活动，或者参加保守派集会, 并且选举合适的人到领导岗位。
