8/11/2022   Miles Guo’s GETTR: The CCP cannot infiltrate the entire U.S., and their framing of me through manipulating various lawsuits against me have left traces. My bankruptcy case and the report cited by ZeroHedge will expose many bad guys in the end. The racial discrimination and arrogance,  the corruption and bureaucracy, especially the manipulation by foreign forces in the U.S. legal system will all be brought to light.

8/11/2022 文贵盖特：美国并非完全被中共渗透，中共通过操纵各种案子对我进行的陷害都会留下痕迹。我的破产案和零对冲转发的关于我的报道最终都会让一堆坏人暴露于天下，包括美国法律体系中的种族歧视和傲慢、腐败和官僚，特别是外国势力的操控，都会被曝光。
