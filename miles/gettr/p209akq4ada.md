11/30/2022 Miles Guo: Jiang Zeming’s credit includes the peaceful hand-over of power to Hu Jintao, prohibiting the military from engaging in business activities and not going extreme in persecuting the protesters of the June 4th 1989 incident; Jiang’s fault includes his firm oppression of the students’ movement during his tenure as Party Secretary in Shanghai and leading the CCP to rampant corruption through “making a fortune silently”; hand-picking Xi Jinping as the head of CCP was the biggest mistake of Jiang Zemin, but was the best decision for our Whistleblowers’ Movement! #JiangZemin #TiananmenSquareMassacre #CCP #XiJinping

11/30/2022 文贵直播：江泽民功在和平交权给胡锦涛、禁止军队做生意、未大肆追杀八九六四抗议者；其过在于在上海坚决镇压学生运动、通过“闷声发大财”让中共走向极端腐败；江的最大错误是选了习做接班人，但对爆料革命是最正确的决定！
