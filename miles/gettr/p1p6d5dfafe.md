8/29/2022 Fay Fay Show: Zhang Songqiao(Cheung Chung-kiu) sneakily targeted some large-looking exhibition centers and large office buildings, and then used a joint venture company to hold only a small part of it.

8/29/2022 飞飞秀：张松桥偷偷摸摸的弄了一些看上去很大的展览中心、大的写字楼，然后通过一种合资公司的形式在里面只占一点点股份。通过把这个东西写在他的财报上，让他看上去像是占有全部财产的样子，感觉他在香港仍在做大笔投资。
