2022.09.07   It is CCP head Xi Jinping's overseas visit to Kazakhstan before the 20th National Congress of the CCP。The diplomatic significance might be equivalent to the meeting in China is regarded as important as the Zhou Enlai’s Bandung Conference between Mao Zedong and US president Nixon。In particular, Putin could regain the confidence to win the war through Xi's international visit and the full support of SCO. To be seen by the Western world, the SCO has the ambition to replace UN and G7. 
习这次的哈萨克斯坦出访，是20大前。这场外交，相当于当年周恩来的万隆会议，相当于毛泽东和尼克森见面。特别是让普京看到打赢这场仗的信心，要让他看到在上合组织框架下全力支持；要让西方世界看到，上合组织就是代替你联合国，代替你G7组织的。
