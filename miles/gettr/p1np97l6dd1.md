8/21/2022 Miles Guo: I can't tell you why I gave myself an exception to smoke a cigar the other day, but I can share something else with you. Not long ago, some people from a country came to me and told me that they would like to reconsider issuing passports to the NFSC people and GCLUBS members. However, I told them to come back and find me at a later time. We don’t have to beg them for issuing us passports, and it will be the other way around moving forward.

8/21/2022 文贵直播：关于文贵那天破例抽雪茄的事，现在还不能告诉大家原因，但我可以透露一点，不久前，某国又找到我，说可以考虑给新中国联邦人和GCLUBS会员发护照的事，但我说以后再谈，因为我们现在不需要求别人给我们发护照了，而是他们来求我们。
