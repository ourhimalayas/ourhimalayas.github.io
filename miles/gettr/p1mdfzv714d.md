8/12/2022 Miles Guo: Some China concepts stocks announced to voluntarily delist from the NYSE, who will be hurt the most if it happens? The CCP bought off staff working with various funds and government agencies so that they managed to let the money from pension funds, insurance funds, education funds etc. be used to purchase the CCP's ADRs. Once the delisting of these CCP-owned firms occurs, American investors who have investments in the CCP's ADRs will certainly suffer the most.

8/12/2022 文贵直播：中概股宣布在美主动退市，谁是最受伤害的人呢？中共买通了美国银行和政府从业人员，使得一些本应受严格监管的资金如养老、保险、教育基金等被用于购买了中共发行的美国存托凭证。一旦这些中共公司退市，买到这些存托凭证的美国投资人必定是最大受害者
