8/14/2022 Miles Guo: All the articles smearing me published on Wall Street Journal and New York Times were arranged by Hu Shuli and Bruno Wu; all the lawsuits against me were paid by Bruno Wu; the aim of Pepe Escobar's article is to provide false evidence for the court. Qu Guojiao, who is quoted in the article, is currently being detained in Communist China. The document mentioned by the article forged my signature!

8/14/2022 文贵直播：所有华尔街日报和纽约时报诬陷我的文章都是胡舒立和吴征操作的；所有告我的官司都是吴征付的钱；Pepe Escobar的文章旨在给法庭提供假证据，其中引用的证人屈国姣目前被关押在中共国，提供的文件伪造了我的签名！
