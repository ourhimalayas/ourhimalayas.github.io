2022.10.03 The Philippines will be more pro-Chinese but more anti-the CCP. After the inflection point of Ukraine war appears, people should set October 1 as Memorial Day of Chinese. June 4th shall be the real National Day of the new China after the CCP is taken down.
（无LOGO版）菲律宾将更亲华，但更反共. 
俄乌战争改变以后，就会把10月1号定为国殇日，把6月4号定为真正中国的新生日.
