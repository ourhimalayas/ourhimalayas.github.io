【NFSC @CPAC 】03/02/2023 Former CA Representative Devin Nunes: Unfortunately, the infiltration problem has just gotten worse because the CCP now is really just a dictatorship.

【新中国联邦DC星火行动】03/02/2023 前加州众议员德文·努内斯：很不幸，中共的渗透问题现在变得更加严重了，因为中共现在就是一个独裁政权。当我们开始在美国或者我们的盟友那里生产更多的产品的时候，每个人都会从中获益。我们不能继续资助一个独裁政权。
