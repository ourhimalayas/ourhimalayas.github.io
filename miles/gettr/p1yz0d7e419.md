2022.11.20 During the G20 meeting, every participated nation has got its fair share of the CCP’s aggression. The West will not forget such humiliation and the next few generations of the people in China will pay the price for Xi’s madness.

G20会议还没结束，各国已经感受到中共嚣张的气焰，以及侮辱的态度，西方各国不会忘掉这种羞辱的，接下来中国几代人可能都将为了习近平这一人的疯狂付出代价。
