02/20/2023 Nicole Tsai: CCP tries everything to send Miles Guo back to China and destroy him and the Whistleblower Movement that he's been leading, including launching unrestricted judicial warfare and bringing more than 76 lawsuits against him; infiltrating US federal government agencies like the Department of Justice; compromising former DOJ employee George Higginbotham, power brokers Elliott Broidy and Stephen Wynn to lobby the Trump administration and DOJ. But people seldom heard about the stories because the CCP has successfully controlled America's mainstream media. 

02/20/2023 妮可：为了将郭文贵先生遣返回中共国、为了摧毁他及其领导的爆料革命，中共倾尽了一国之力。比如对他发起司法超限战，提起了超过76起缠诉；渗透美国司法部等联邦政府机构；收买前司法部雇员乔治·希金波坦、权力掮客埃利奧特·布洛伊迪和史提芬·永利游说川普政府和司法部。但人们却很少能从主流媒体上听到这些事情，因为这些媒体已被中共完全控制。
