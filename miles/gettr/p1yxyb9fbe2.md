11/19/2022  Miles Guo’s GETTR: The U.S. and the West have decided to take actions against the CCP in economic and sci-tech fields. They will cut off the supply to the CCP in chips, softwares, products and talents. Meanwhile, they will ally with countries in Asia-Pacific to control the supply chain in that region so as to impede the economic growth of the CCP. To address the concerns about the COVID vaccine disaster and the COVID origins can be the best starting point for the West to counterattack the CCP.
