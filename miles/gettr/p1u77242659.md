10/13/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Although it is useless to pull banners to oppose Xi in Beijing, the Chinese people’s discontent and outrage towards the CCP has gone far beyond what happened before the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre. Those inside the CCP’s military are afraid of the war on Taiwan, with many of them trying to figure out how to save themselves. The false prosperity of the Hong Kong economy can no longer sustain. The CCP’s domestic economy will go bust in the following three aspects: banking, real estate, and state-owned enterprises. So, how is it possible for the CCP to stay strong?

10/13/2022 文贵盖特：虽然在北京拉横幅反习没有用，但中国人对中共的不满和愤怒已经超过了8964之前的情况；中共军队内部惧怕打台湾，很多人在想如何保命；香港经济的假擀面杖子撑不住了，国内的经济崩溃将爆发在银行、房地产和国企这三个方面，中共怎么可能还会强大呢？
