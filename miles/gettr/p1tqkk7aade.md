2022.10.09 这是我们的过去……也是我们的未来……现在已经成为最奢侈的奢望，……无价无法获得的曾经和已经被玷污的殿堂……我们来自这里，我们却要毁掉她们……这一切，这一切的一切……都是中国共产党和世界的邪恶的黑势力造成的！我们该如何面对？我们该如何珍惜？请大家系好你的裤腰带！珍惜没有疫苗的，上天给我们最大的礼物和神圣的使命吧！2022.10.09 This is our past and also our future...but now this has become the most extravagant hope, the priceless and unobtainable history, and the palace which has been already defiled. We all came from here but turns out we are going to destroy them. All of this, all of this, all of this... is caused by the Chinese Communist Party and the evil dark side of the world! How should we face it? How should we cherish it? Everyone, please fasten your belts! Please cherish those who do not get vaccinated. This is the greatest gift and sacred mission that GOD gave us!
