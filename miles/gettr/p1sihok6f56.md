9/28/2022 Miles Guo: Although Wang Qishan did not attend the recent exhibition touting the achievements of Xi in his 10 years in power, he has not been arrested and is doing fine. Only the Whistleblowers’ Movement, the New Federal State of China, and I have the guts to debunk CCP rumors and deliver the truths about the CCP to the entire world. Xi Jinping's public appearance after 10 days of hiding has proven how capable the Whistleblowers’ Movement is.

9/28/2022 文贵直播：虽然王岐山最近没有出席吹捧习10年执政业绩的展览，但他并未被抓而且啥事都没有；全世界只有爆料革命、新中国联邦和文贵才敢揭穿中共的谣言并向世界传递关于中共的真相；习近平神隐10天后的公开露面验证了爆料革命很牛！
