【NFSC @CPAC 】03/02/2023  Enemy Within writer Trevor Loudon: If you're Xi Jinping and you wanted to bring down America, you won’t want to risk a multibillion-dollar trade war you might lose, or you don’t want to risk a multi-trillion dollar shooting war, the most effective way is to spend just a few billion dollars buying American politicians to do your bidding for you. Judy Chu, Grace Meng, Mitch McConnell and Dianne Feinstein are all co-opted by the CCP and are working in CCP’s interests. It’s time for us to take them accountable.

【新中国联邦DC星火行动】03/02/2023 《内部的敌人》作者特雷弗·劳登:如果你是习近平，并且你想推翻美国，你不会花费巨额金钱去打一场你可能会输掉的贸易战，或者花费巨额金钱去打一场热战。最有效的方式就是仅花费数十亿美元收买美国政客为你服务。 赵美心、孟昭文、米奇·麦康奈尔和戴安·范士丹等都被中共收买并为中共利益工作。
