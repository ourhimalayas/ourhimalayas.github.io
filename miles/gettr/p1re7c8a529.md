2022.09.19 After Putin’s death, either Russia would enter a state of war and eventually disintegrated or some pro-Europe and pro-America leader might come out and build a good relationship with the west. No matter which, it will be a huge disaster for the Chinese people. Secondly, after Putin’s death, the U.S. would take care of the mess (Russia-Ukraine war), otherwise Russia’s nuclear weapons would pose a great threat to the U.S. and Europe. Thirdly, after Putin’s death, the entire Europe might enter a huge turmoil in the near term.
（无LOGO版）普亡后，要么俄罗斯将进入战乱状态然后最终被肢解，或者可能某个亲欧亲美的人会出来和西方搞好关系。不管哪种情况，对中国人民都将是巨大的灾难。第二，普亡后，美国将收拾这个烂摊子，否则俄罗斯的核武器将对美国和欧洲形成巨大的威胁。第三，普亡后，整个欧洲在近期可能会进入巨大的动荡。
