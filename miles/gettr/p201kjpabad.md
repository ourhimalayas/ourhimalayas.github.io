11/28/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL, Little Cake, a fellow fighter from Himalaya Taiwan Farm who ran out of CCP China, protested against Paul Hastings Japan. Because of listening to the Whistleblower Movement, she has a deep sight of the CCP's infiltration of Western democracies . She does not want the democracy and freedom in West to be destroyed by CCP， so she stands up and speak out, hoping to wake up more people to expose those people in the West who have been compromised by CCP's BGY. So the precious democracy and freedom can be protected.

11/28/2022 对邪恶说不，从墙内润出来的来自台湾农场的小蛋糕战友参加了日本抗议普衡活动。她因为听了爆料革命，对中共渗透西方民主国家有更深的认识。她不愿意在西方获得的自由被中共渗透后拿走，因此愿意站出来发声，希望唤醒更多民众来揭露身边的普衡，揭露那些被中共蓝金黄拉下水的西方重要人士，以保护民主和自由。
