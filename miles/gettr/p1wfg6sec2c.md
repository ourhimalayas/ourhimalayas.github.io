2022.11.01 The three types of Sino-American warfare will be all about firstly in communication and electronic warfare.  Secondly, it is the missile; whoever gets the missile superiority will gain the upper hand. Lastly, it is to ensue a wipeout war with nukes depending on whoever dares, or has the nerves to deploy it. Technology, economy, and determination will decide who wins the war. And for Taiwan with its limited capability in comparison, you will have to hit back first and hang in there for at least three hours, then the cavalry will arrive from the US and Europe.
  美共两军开战，打的就三件事，第一个，通信，第二，导弹，第三，核战。
