12/12/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL, fellow fighter Mr. Tomato commented the two most famous pro-communist incidents of Toshihiro Nikai. He was a transport minister and brought 13,000 Japanese to the Great Hall of the People to be received by CCP. He said to the Communist government official that you can take our Shinkansen technology and the advanced aviation technology whenever you need.  
12/12/2022 对邪恶说不，Tomato战友评二阶俊博最有名的两件亲共事件。作为运输大臣，二阶俊博带了13000名日本人到人民大会堂去受中共接见。他对中国官员说，我们的先进的新干线和航空技术，你们随时需要，随时拿去。
