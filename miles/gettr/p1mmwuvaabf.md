8/14/2022 Miles Guo: The ban on the export of EDA software will force China to regress to the Stone Age. None of the commitments the CCP made to the West when it entered the WTO has been fulfilled, while the U.S. and Europe have never let China possess any core technology and equipment. In the future, you will see in China that airplanes fail to take off, satellites fall from the sky, the Chinese people have no medicines to take when they are sick, computers cannot be turned on, and even the PCR testing cannot be carried out anymore

8/14/2022文贵直播：美国对中共国停售EDA会将中国打回到石器时代。中共从未兑现加入WTO后对西方的承诺，而欧美也从未将各种核心技术和设备给过中共国。今后在中共国，将会看到飞机不能飞，卫星掉下来、老百姓有病没药吃、电脑无法开机，甚至连核糖核酸都测不了
