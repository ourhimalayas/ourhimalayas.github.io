8/22/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Fellow fighters, it is very important to have families and friends around at the time of immense disasters. Be sure to let the Himalaya Alliance Committee know when you experience difficulties and suffer from serious illnesses, and the Himalaya Alliance Committee and the Himalaya Farms must stand with the fellow fighters. Fellow fighters, we must safeguard our Himalaya Coins well to cope with the unknown world in the future. We must stay strong and united!

8/22/2022 文贵盖特：战友们，在大灾大难的时候有家人和朋友很重要！战友们如果有苦有难或生大病了，务必要跟联盟说，联盟和农场一定要和战友站在一起；战友们要好好地维护咱们的币以面对未来未知的世界；我们要强大、要团结！
