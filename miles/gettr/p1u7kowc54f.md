2022.10.13 The CCP heavily infiltrated South America and built many military facilities in countries like Cuba, Argentina and Brazil. What you are let known is called news. what you are not let known is called national security and/or national secrets. Everything that goes behind the scenes is a deal. The part of the deal that can’t go under the sun is called politics.
（无LOGO版）中共大肆渗透南美并在像古巴、巴西、阿根廷这样的国家建了许多军事设施。你知道的叫新闻，你不知道的叫叫国家安全和机密。所有背后的都是交易。交易的背后都见不得光的那部分叫政治。
