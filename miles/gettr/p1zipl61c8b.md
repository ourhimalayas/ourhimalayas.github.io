2022.11.24 The Chinese Communist Party and Paul Hastings had plotted from the beginning to forge a non-existing $30 million personal guarantee with my signature. The next step was to infiltrate US judicial system, to cause the court to come up with the ruling of contempt of court, turning $30 million into a fine of more than $300 million. 	
共产党和普衡一开始就设计，弄了一个根本不存在的说是郭先生签字的3000万个人担保，然后渗透影响法院做出郭先生藐视法庭的判决，硬生生把一个无中生有的3000万美金，搞成了3个多亿的法庭罚款。
