2022.11.13 The main underlying reason for FTX's bankruptcy is dipping into clients' funds. This was all controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and taken down by Zhao Changpeng. Any crypto exchanges that dip into clients' funds, will end sooner or later. It's basic common sense that you can't touch clients' funds.

（无LOGO版）  FTX这次破产的最大根本原因就是他动用了客户的钱。这一切受共产党控制，被赵长鹏给干掉了，计划掉。所有的交易所和数字货币，只要你去动用客户的钱，你早晚一天你得死。人家客户的钱你不能动，这是个基本的常识。
