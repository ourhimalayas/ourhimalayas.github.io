02/16/2023 Natalie Winters: Catherine Dooling, the daughter in law of Shan Weijian who has repeatedly engaged in law fair against Miles Guo, is funneling either indirectly or directly money to the parent company of Mother Jones that is routinely attacking NFSC and Miles. But in any of these articles none of this is ever disclosed. This is another perfect example of CCP’s infiltration into the US.

 02/16/2023 娜塔莉·温特斯：一直在对郭文贵先生进行司法缠诉的单伟建的儿媳凯瑟琳·杜琳正直接或间接向《琼斯母亲》杂志的母公司输送资金，以便让该杂志不停刊文攻击郭先生和新中国联邦，但他们这些文章里却没有披露这些内容。这是中共对美渗透的又一完美例子。
