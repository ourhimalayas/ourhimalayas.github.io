2022.10.06 The CCP was so arrogant in 2018 and intended to buy over the world. Fu Zhenhua said Meng Jianzhu would definitely be arrested. As a representative of the Jiang faction, Meng remained in office out of CCP’s strategic consideration, but, he was only a nominal official. If Mr. Guo had been convinced by Fu to go to Britain, he would certainly have faced assassination or poisoning. Fu Zhenhua was so arrogant at that time and looked as if he was about to conquer the sun.
（无LOGO版）2018年共产党之嚣张！在全世界的买、买、买！傅振华说建柱一定会被抓起来的。因为孟建柱是代表江家的，现在战略上需要他，但是已经把他架空了。如果郭先生被他劝说去了英国肯定被枪杀或者被毒死。傅振华当时那个傲慢，就差统治太阳了。
