11/07/2022 Timeline 19 P2: The CCP not only exploit the Chinese people in the Chinese stock market, but also took advantage of the loopholes in U.S. regulations after the WTO by colluding with Wall Street to list in the U.S. and enrich themselves. Fortunately, the situation was brought under control when President Trump signed the HFCAA in 2021.

11/07/2022 “时间点” 第19期 P2：中共不仅在中国股市割中国人民的韭菜，更是在WTO之后利用美国法规上的漏洞，通过和华尔街勾结，在美国上市并大肆圈钱。幸好在2021年川普总统签署了《外国公司问责法》，情况才得以控制。
