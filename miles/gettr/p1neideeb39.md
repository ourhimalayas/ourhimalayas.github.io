8/18/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: For any Chinese Lao Baixing who distinguish themselves by, for instance, becoming an entrepreneur, they will inevitably be attacked by the CCP. The officiallings or the second rich generation are so low that they only live for food and sex. In contrast, the Whistleblowers’ Movement upholds the principle of non-violence and pursues justice, freedom, and rule of law, and it is a revolution initiated by the basic human instinct for survival.

8/18/2022 文贵盖特：中国老百姓但凡出人头地，诸如成为企业家，就会遭到中共的打击；官二代富二代们毫无信仰，低级到只为食和色而活；爆料革命坚持非暴力，追求正义、自由和法治，它是人类出于生存本能的一场革命
