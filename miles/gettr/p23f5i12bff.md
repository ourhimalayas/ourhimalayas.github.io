12/29/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 40: For those who deliberately took photos of our fellow fighters' protests, we will continue to collect evidence and defend our rights through legal proceedings in due course, as these photos may become a tool for the CCP to threaten our fellow fighters' loved ones in China.

12/29/2022 对邪恶说不 第40天：对于那些故意拍摄战友们抗议的行为，由于这些照片有可能会成为中共威胁战友们在国内亲人的工具，所以，我们会继续收集证据，并适时通过法律程序来维护自己的权益。
