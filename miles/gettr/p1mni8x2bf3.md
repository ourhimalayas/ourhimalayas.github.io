8/14/2022 Miles Guo: The photo of me with long hair standing in front of Capitol Hill captured one of the most important moments in my life. It was that trip to Washington DC really showed me that the CCP's infiltration in the United States was way too deep and thus the CCP's evil plans against the US would inevitably happen, and that gave me the hope to take down the CCP. The moment when the darkness of the US judicial system is unveiled will be the moment when the Whistleblowers' Movement goes global!

8/14/2022 文贵直播：在国会山前长发飘飘的照片捕捉了文贵人生中最重要的时刻。正是那次的华盛顿之行让文贵看到了中共对美国的渗透之深，所以中共针对美国的一系列邪恶计划一定会发生，这给了文贵灭共的希望；美国司法黑暗揭开之时就是爆料革命走向国际之日！
