9/2/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: In the past few centuries, the West has proved that they can adapt themselves to the new change and keep moving forward by creating more new technologies, civilizations, and new ways of living. On the contrary, the CCP can only create more disasters and cause more deaths in every crisis. Even though the CCP is planning to impose all kinds of taxes on the Chinese people to prolong their remaining days, they have no idea all their efforts will be in vain in the face of the COVID vaccine disaster.

9/2/2022 文贵盖特：几个世纪以来，西方在每次危机中都能调整自己不断进步，创造出更多新科技、新文明和新生活方式。而中共在危机中只是制造出更多灾难和死亡。尽管中共已计划通过征收各种税来苟延残喘，但它们完全不知道在疫苗灾难前，它们所有的挣扎都会变成无用功。
