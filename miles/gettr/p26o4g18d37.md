2023.01.29 The newly elected Speaker McKenzie has proposed many new policies against the Chinese Communist Party. Uncle Sam and his fellow fighters are continuing to protest in DC for the GTV platform that was shut down by the SEC and the investment money that was frozen, and also for the natural human rights of everyone, without being racially discriminated against, to get back our rights and investment.
新当选的议长麦肯锡提出很多针对中共国的新政，山姆大叔和战友们为了被SEC关闭的GTV平台和被冻结的投资款在DC持续抗议，同时也是为了属于每个人的 天赋人权，不被种族歧视而抗议，一定要拿回属于我们的权利和投资。
