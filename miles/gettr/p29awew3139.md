2/21/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 94: The CCP has imposed numerous barriers for a fellow fighter's family to access their bank accounts in Communist China. The fellow fighter’s mother had always wanted to return to China, but after visiting several protest sites in and near New York, having witnessed with her own eyes what is happening in Communist China and the US, and learning about the evil of the CCP, she decided not to return to China until the CCP is taken down.
