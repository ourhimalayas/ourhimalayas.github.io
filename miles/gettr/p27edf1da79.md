2023.02.05 Miles Guo warned the U.S. many times that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had a plan, and the ability, to create cheap high-altitude balloons to wage Unrestricted Warfare against the U.S. However, the U.S. bureaucracy and the lobbyists assisting the CCP, prevented the U.S. from taking it seriously.
