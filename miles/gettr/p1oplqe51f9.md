2022.08.28 Alex Jones giving President Trump a deadline to expose the truth of the danger of the vaccines will do Trump a lot of harm. Whichever choice President Trump makes, it will be bad for him. It is human ignorance to try to explain everything in the world through scientism.

20828-02Alex Johns给川普总统期限要求反疫苗会给川普带来很大的伤害。无论(川普总统)做出什么选择对他都是不利的。试图用科学主义解释世上一切是人类的无知
