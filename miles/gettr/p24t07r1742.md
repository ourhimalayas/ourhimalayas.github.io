01/08/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 50: At first, the police would come to check our protest 2 or 3 times everyday, mainly for reports from the neighbors who didn’t understand the situation. So now, the police basically don’t bother to come at all. Because they know we are protesting against the evil lawyers like Luc Despins’ infiltrated in the US justice system. Our protest is peaceful and legal. 

01/08/2022 对邪恶说不 第50天：最初，因为不知情的邻居的举报，警察每天来检查2-3次。而现在，警察几乎不来检查了。因为他们知道我们在抗议Luc这种邪恶的律师的在美国司法系统时的渗透。我们的抗议活动是合法，和平的。
