【NFSC @CPAC 】03/02/2023  Congressman Scott Perry: Under the Biden administration, I'm not sure where they're going to get any of those kinds of recognitions to NFSC. The Biden administration seems very close to the Chinese Communist Party or intimidated by the Communist Chinese party. We probably need to wait another 2 years when we have a new president who is willing to confront the CCP to give the NFSC some sort of recognition

【新中国联邦DC星火行动】03/02/2023 国会议员斯科特·佩里：在拜登政府时期，我不确定他们会给予新中国联邦某种认可。拜登政府看起来与中共非常近，或者他们受到中共威胁。我们很可能需要再等两年，当我们选出一个愿意同中共对抗的总统后，会给予新中国联邦一些认可。
