03/01/2023 Nicole and Prince interviewed by Steve Bannon at CPAC: The CCP has more than 90 million members, but only more than a little over 100 people are considered the kleptocrats who control 99% of the wealth. They placed their wives, children, and their assets in the US. So it's very easy for America to do is to apply the global Magnitsky Act or Rico act, freeze the asset and stop giving the financial blood and all the technology transfer to the CCP. 

03/01/2023 妮可和小王子在CPAC现场接受史蒂夫·班农的采访：中共有9000万多名党员，但只有100多人被认为是掌握99%财富的盗国贼。 他们将妻子、孩子和他们的资产放在美国。所以美国很容易做的就是应用全球马格尼茨基法案或RICO法案，冻结他们的资产，停止向中共经济输血和进行所有技术转让。
