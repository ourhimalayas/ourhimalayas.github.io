11/24/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL: If Weijian Shan's daughter-in-law's father is a good man, he should ask himself where the money of his son-in-law's family comes from. He should know that tragedies that are happening in China every day are because of the spies like Weijian Shan who are aiding and abetting the evil CCP!

11/24/2022 对邪恶说不: 单伟建的亲家如果是个好人也应该扪心自问，自己女婿家的钱是从哪里来的？他应该知道中国每天上演的悲剧就是因为有单伟建这样的中共间谍在助纣为虐！
