2022.11.26 The CCP's national policy is to disrupt the world's supply chain, crush the U.S. dollar and economy, and let the Chinese return to the era of great famine and chew tree bark and grass. The greed of Western capitalism has altered many people's hearts. These capitalists hope China will resume the zero-Covid policy and continue to do business with the CCP, regardless of the life and death of the Chinese people. At present, only the New Federal State of China is lifting the lid on the world. We want America and the Chinese people to flourish. We long for a world of the rule of law, religion, and faith, every good thing but the CCP.
打破世界的供应链，摧毁美国的美元和美国的经济，让中国人回到吃草的时代是国策。西方资本主义他的贪婪让很多人变了心。就这些人就希望中国恢复隔离清零，继续跟中共做生意，根本不管中国老百姓的死活！现在整个世界，只有一个新中国联邦在告诉世界真相。
