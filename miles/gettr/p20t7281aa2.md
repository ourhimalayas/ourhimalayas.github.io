12/4/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 15: It is said that our ongoing protests have hit Luc Despins hard, making him weep alone often;  an American fellow fighter spent both Thanksgiving and his birthday at the protest site, and all the other fellow fighters of the New Federal State of China have been touched and motivated by his persistence.

12/4/2022 对邪恶说不 第15天：据说战友们持续的抗议对卢克打击不小，他经常偷偷地自己哭；一位美国战友的感恩节和生日都是在抗议现场度过的，他的坚持感动和激励着其他新中国联邦的战友。
