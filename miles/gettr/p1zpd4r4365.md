11/25/2022 Miles Guo's GETTR: Visiting Saudi Arabia in December has already been planned by Xi Jinping; the CCP’s plan of locking down cities was finalized a year ago. If the Lao Baixing keep resisting, they will be facing the worst time of completely losing power, water and communications; Hu Jintao and his son are both in bad shape, and Hu Chunhua might be appointed to suppress riots, so, what does that mean to us?

11/25/2022文贵盖特：习太阳早就计划在12月去沙特；中共的隔离围城封城计划一年前就已制定好，若百姓继续反抗，将面临断水断电断通讯的最坏时刻；胡锦涛和他儿子身体状况都不好，胡春华可能会派去平爆，这又意味着什么呢？
