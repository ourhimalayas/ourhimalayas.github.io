2022.08.27 One of Qishan Wang’s buddies has been arrested, and it’s not a central government approval. It was said the arrest by accident when a local task force was working on a case. From this case, it means Qishan Wang’s power within China has gone. For those Swamps in China, the Wang’s umbrella might be gone as well. 

王岐山的一哥们又被抓了，而且不是中央批示。据说地方专案组办案涉及到他。因为抓他，偶然性的，都敢抓他，说明王岐山的保护伞已经没了； 这也说明，那些沼泽地，玩宏观经济的，在中国的保护伞也可能没了。
