2022.09.27 The information that has spread online regarding Xi and Jiang is a rumor. Not a single word of Xi’s internal speech could possibly be leaked out. The Shenyang district military commander assassinating Xi, the entering of military vehicles fleet in Beijing, etc. are all rumors. The various embassies in China are gathering disinformation from incompetent sources.
（无LOGO版）网上关于习江的信息都是谣言：江泽民还活着；习的内部讲话一个字都不可能被贴在网路上；来自沈阳军区的李某军将军车开进北京，接管了北京，干掉了习等等均是谣言。各国驻华使馆的信息不可靠，因为与之交往的中国线人都是垃圾。
