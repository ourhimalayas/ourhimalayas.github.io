11/28/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL, Himalaya Sakura farm fellow fighters continued to protest in front of the Paul Hastings’ Tokyo Roppongi office building against Lu Despines and Paul Hastings colluding with CCP. The peaceful protesters spoke of Luke's extortion of $250 million from Mr. Miles Guo or he wants to destroy Mr. Miles Guo, destroy the NFSC, destroy the Whistleblower Movement. His approach is exactly like the tactics used by CCP. NFSCers will continue to protest and tell the truth to the world.

11/28/2022对邪恶说不，喜马拉雅樱花的战友们继续在东京六本木普衡律师事务所办公大楼前抗议卢克和普衡与中共勾结的行为。和平抗议的战友们谈到卢克向郭文贵先生勒索2. 5亿美元，否则他要撕毁郭文贵先生，撕毁新中国联邦，撕毁爆料革命。他的手法与中共如的手段如出一辙。新中国联邦人将继续抗议，向世界说出真相。
