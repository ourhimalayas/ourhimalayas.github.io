8/27/2022 Miles Guo's GETTR:  The European countries have achieved consensus on sanctioning and decoupling from Communist China in various sectors. However, the CCP won’t just sit there awaiting its doom, and it will hammer the U.S. economy heavily at critical moments. It leaves no room for the U.S. and the West to compromise and give in to the CCP. It is either they end the CCP, or let the CCP end them.

8/27/2022 文贵盖特：欧洲国家在制裁中共以及各领域与中共国脱钩方面基本达成一致，但中共不会坐以待毙，也会对美国经济在关键时刻出重锤。美国和西方没有任何交易和退让的空间，要么灭掉中共，要么被中共灭。
