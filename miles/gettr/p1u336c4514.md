10/12/2022 Miles Guo: The reason I smoked cigars lately is that the U.S. will soon impose sanctions on the CCP and Hong Kong. About 20 international airlines will suspend their flights to Hong Kong. Without foreign tourists and investments, will the Hong Kong stock market sustain itself? Once the CCP's state-owned enterprises are sanctioned by the U.S., the Hang Seng Index will fall from the current 16,000 points to 8,000 or 9,000 points. Although the HKD will not crash very soon, it can only hold out for six months to a year at most.

10/12/2022 文贵直播：文贵最近抽雪茄的原因是美国将马上对中共和香港实施制裁；约有20几家国际航空要取消飞香港的航线，没有了外国游客和投资，港股能撑住吗？中共国企一旦被美国制裁，港股将从16000点左右跌至8、9千点；港币虽不会马上崩盘，但最多只能撑过半年到一年
