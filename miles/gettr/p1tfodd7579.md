There are probably ten or twenty financial institutions in the West helping the CCP with operating foreign exchange including arm trades, overseas selling of arms. At the same time, they cooperate with Bank of China, China Development Bank, China Postal Savings Bank, China Construction Bank, China Agricultural Bank which are the biggest state-owned banks Under CCP control. The above Chinese banks make transactions with overseas counterpart banks quietly. One of them is Credit Suisse.
