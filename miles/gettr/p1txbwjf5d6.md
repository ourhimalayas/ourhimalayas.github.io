2022.10.11 The CCP has always been an evil system. To ensure its tyranny, the system can eliminate those who have not been trusted. No matter whom or when this has never changed. After the ”Twentieth National Congress Meeting”, Xi Jinping’s political succession will create the biggest shake-up in The Chinese Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Central Political and Legal Affairs, the PLA, and the Financial sector. As only those may threaten Xi’s political power, the others won’t. 
（无LOGO版）中共的邪恶体制一始贯之，为了维护其统治杀掉那些不被信任的人，无论是谁，无论什么时间从未改变。二十大以后，习近平连任后会对中纪委，政法委，军队，金融界大开杀戒，因为只有这些会威胁到他的权力，其他的不会。
