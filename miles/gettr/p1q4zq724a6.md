2022.09.08 The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) repeatedly said that the great disaster rejuvenates the nation. CCP China will prosper upon its own citizen’s death. CCP calls it a method of balancing wealth. Balancing by natural disaster with the cost of human’s lives. The norm that the CCP applies is to delete online posts. No one is allowed to speak out. The CCP is controlling the media and forcing people to keep their mouth shut. This is the sorrow of our entire Chinese nationality. Human’s life is valued less than an ant in CCP China.
CCP一而再再而三的说大难兴国, 大难兴邦. 多死人就兴邦. 这是CCP财富平衡的一种办法. 用死人来自然平衡.现在共产党干的最多的事情就是删帖. 不允许发言. 控制媒体管住嘴. 这就是咱们整个中国人的悲哀. 死人真的连个蚂蚁都不如.
