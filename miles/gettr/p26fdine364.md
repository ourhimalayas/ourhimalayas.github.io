1/25/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 67: When a policeman learned that we were here protesting against a CCP spy, he was very grateful and said that he didn't want his children to receive any Communism education; another couple who came in their truck also said they would write a letter to the Congress and the CCP’s pawns and running dogs such as Watson Meng should not be allowed to live in this community!

1/25/2023 对邪恶说不第67天：当警察得知我们在这里是为了抗议中共间谍时，他非常感激，并说他不希望自己的孩子接受共产主义教育；另一对开着卡车过来的夫妇也表示要给国会写信，绝不允许韦石(孟维参)这样的伪类和中共走狗住在这个社区!
