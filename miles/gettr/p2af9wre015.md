【NFSC@CPAC 】3/3/2023 Chairman of Lorain County Young Republicans Greg Fanning: The CCP has been purchasing farmland in Iowa and using it for their self gain, which is like a country hostile to the US interests is profiting off their enemy by buying the farmland. It's also the equivalent of having Nazis buy farmland in Iowa during World War Two. There's been a lot of U.S. officials implicated in this including Brian Kemp

【新中国联邦DC星火行动】3/3/2023 俄亥俄州青年共和党人主席格雷格·范宁：中共政在爱荷华州购买农田将用于他们自己的利益，就像一个敌视美国利益的国家从他们的敌人身上获利，相当于在第二次世界大战期间让纳粹在爱荷华州购买农田，有很多美国官员包括佐治亚州州长布莱恩·坎普也参与了此事。
