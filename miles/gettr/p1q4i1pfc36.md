2022.09.08 China and Russia are united for strategic reasons. They are quite pleased about the influence of natural gas and oil on Europe and the US. While Xi Jinping makes huge commitments to the members of the SCO summit, he is turning the Russia-Ukraine war into a war of those summit countries.
中俄抱团取暖，非常高兴天然气和石油对欧美的影响，习近平会对上合峰会成员许下巨大承诺，同时习把俄乌战争变成一个上合峰会的战争。
