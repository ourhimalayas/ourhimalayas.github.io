Day 9 of our peaceful protest against targeted racial discrimination and political persecution of Chinese Americans! Seven locations across America. Our posters are bigger, and our messages are louder. #Day9saynotoevil 

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has fiercely assaulted the American judicial system while most Americans slept. Through seemingly independent intermediaries like Luc Despins and Paul Hastings, the CCP successfully weaponized the American legal system to persecute the CCP's most-wanted dissidents in America.

Drop by two of our New York peaceful protest sites:
Paul Hastings, New York office @ the MetLife building 
O'Melveny & Myers, New York office @ the 7 Times Square
