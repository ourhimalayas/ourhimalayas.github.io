2022.11.18 During Xi Jinping's visit to the G20 summit in Indonesia this time, the entire visiting group has 560 people, used four Air China’s Boeing 747 aircraft. This is also the first time that a Chinese country leader has used four special aircraft for a foreign visit. And Xi Jinping appeared in front of the leaders of the nation as a King and made it very clear that he came here only to talk about money, not politics.
