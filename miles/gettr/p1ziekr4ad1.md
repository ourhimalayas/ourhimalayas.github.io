2022.11.23 To stop the protests of our fellow fighters, Luc, the thug of the CCP, applied to the judge to ask us to stop using the media, and issue subpoenas to many of our fellow fighters. They also used blackmail, threats, and extortion to threaten the lives and property of our fellow fighters.
为了阻止我们战友的抗议，中共的走狗Luc向法官提出申请要求我们禁止使用媒体，并向我们的许多战友发出了传票。还用敲诈、威胁、勒索对战友们带来了生命、财产的威胁。
