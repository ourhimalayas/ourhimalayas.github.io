2/12/2023 Miles Guo: Communist China's GDP growth is definitely negative! More than 200 million Chinese people are unemployed, and the real estate and construction industries, as well as the over 80 industries that are supported by them, will all be finished. As a result, export-oriented foreign trade enterprises are also going to collapse, and the remaining service industries and other sectors are falling apart as well.
