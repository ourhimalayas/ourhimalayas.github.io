【AMFEST 2022】12/18/2022  Investigative journalists Heather Mullins and Joshua Hilipp: Joshua said what the CCP fear the most is people standing up to it as people speaking out against it.  The reason why they censor everything is because they fear the truth will come out. Once the Chinese people wake up and realize their big fat lie,that’s the end of the CCP. Heather said we got to live our lives with integrity, and we got to stand up for our values. We have to take the risks to defend our country and our family.

【凤凰城涅槃行动】12/18/2022  调查记者Heather Mullins 和Joshua Hilipp: Joshua说到，中共最害怕的就是人们站出来发声，他们禁言一切的原因是他们害怕真相暴露出来。一旦中国人民醒过来，并且认识到他们的弥天大谎时，那就是中共的终结之时。 Heather说：我们需要诚实地活着，我们需要坚守我们的价值观，而且我们需要承担那些风险去保卫我们的国家和家人。
