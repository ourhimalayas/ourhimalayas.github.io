2022.11.24 Shan Weijian took the initiative to ask for a settlement, but was thwarted by the Chinese Communist Party and Paul Hastings. All the cases against Miles Guo and the Whistleblower Movement have been initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The same people are behind them all.  

单伟建主动要求和解，但是被共产党和普衡从中作梗。所有的针对七哥和爆料革命的案子全部出自司法部，背后是同一拨人 。
