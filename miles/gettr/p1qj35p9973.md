9/11/2022 Miles Guo: Europe's pro-Russia and pro-CCP policy will make it hard for its economy to return to its previous level in the next five to ten years. Russia will for sure disintegrate, but the EU would have disintegrated earlier than Russia if the Russia-Ukraine war didn't happen; If the Europeans want to become energy independent, they will have to focus more on the Middle East and Africa in addition to exploring new energy sources.

9/11/2022 文贵直播：欧洲亲俄亲共的政策导致其经济在未来五到十年内很难恢复到从前的水平；俄罗斯一定解体，但如果不是俄乌战争，欧洲会比俄罗斯更早解体；欧洲要实现能源独立，除了发展新能源外，今后一定会大力转向中东和非洲。
