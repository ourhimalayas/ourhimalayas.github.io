2022.10.13 Why has Chinese Communist China gone all the way to the small island of the Bahamas to build one of the world's top five largest embassies? Between 30 to 50 of 100-150 meter-long  freighters constantly anchored nearby.  The lower decks of those ships are loaded with shoulder-fired missiles, spy listening and tracking systems.  These are spy ships, spy tankers.  After all these years, the United States has been completely desensitized by the Chinese Communist Party and Wall Street.
（无LOGO版）为什么一个中共国跑到巴哈马一个小岛上建了一个全世界前五大的大使馆？旁边经常停着30-50艘100-150米的货轮，那货船下面全都是能放那肩扛式导弹的小型导弹系统、监听系统、跟踪系统。就是间谍之船！间谍之轮！美国这些年已经被共产党还有华尔街给搞得已经完全是麻木了！
