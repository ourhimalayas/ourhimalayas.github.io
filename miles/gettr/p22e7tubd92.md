【AMFEST 2022】12/19/2022 Natalie Winters: All the top lobbying firms and all the top legal firms have worked not just with Chinese state-owned companies or subsidiaries of Chinese state-owned companies. But they're often retained by the embassies of China. American law firms are really kind of serving as the legal backbone of propping up the CCP. And of course, they're going after NFSC because you're doing all you can to take down the CCP.

【凤凰城涅槃行动】12/19/2022 娜塔莉·温特斯：所有顶级游说公司、顶级律所，不仅与中共国有企业或国有企业的子公司合作，而且很多时候，他们还被中共使馆聘用。美国律所充当了扶持中共的法律支柱，他们当然会对付新中国联邦，因为你们在竭尽全力推翻中共。
