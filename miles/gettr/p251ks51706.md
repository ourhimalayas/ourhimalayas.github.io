1/13/2023 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 55: On the peaceful protest frontline at the Grand Central Terminal in New York, our fellow fighters came across a religious group from South America, and they prayed for our protests before they left. A freelance writer who wrote a documentary novel about the CCP’s persecution of Uighurs was also touched by our spirit of fighting for righteousness and justice. We can say that our peaceful protests have received support from all walks of life

1/13/2023 对邪恶说不 第55天：在纽约中央车站和平抗议前线的战友遇到了来自南美的一个宗教团体，他们在离开前为我们的抗议活动做了祷告；一位写过中共迫害维吾尔族人纪实文学的自由作家也被我们为公平正义而抗争的精神所感动。可见我们的和平抗议已经得到各界人士的支持
