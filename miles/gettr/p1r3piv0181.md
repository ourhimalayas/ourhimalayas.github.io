2022.09.16 Xi is not worried about the coming 20th National Congress of the CCP, which literally has nothing to do with 1.4 billion Chinese slaves like livestock. The 20th Congress is in Xi’s full control. In Xi’s mind he is the master of everything. It is Xi’s 20th National Congress of the CCP, Xi’s international politics, Xi’s political ambitions and Xi’s historical status in the future. As for the logic of Xi Jinping and Putin, simply put it as: either they unite together or wait to be destroyed. Their choice is obvious alliance. 
习的20大, 跟你中国14亿那些畜奴没有啥关系. 是习的国际政治，习的政治野心，习的未来历史地位，习的钱，习的女人。习、普二人就这么简单，这俩人很清楚他们不联合，他们就等死。
