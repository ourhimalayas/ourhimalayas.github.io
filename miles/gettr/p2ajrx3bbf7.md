【NFSC @CPAC 】03/04/2023 @CFACT National Field Coordinator Greg Neff: The CCP is the most evil and diabolical regime in the world today. They go over and are working systematically to undermine America's security by pushing unethical solar panels that they're using slave labor through the Uighurs to produce. They use child labor from the cobalt that they're pulling out of the Congo. They undermine America's national security by weakening our grid, while they're strengthening theirs using coal technology that's much more reliable. We want to come over and express our support

【新中国联邦DC星火行动】03/04/2023 积极的明天委员会（@CFACT）全国现场协调员格雷格·奈夫: 中共是当今世界最邪恶的政权。他们正在系统化运作破坏美国的国家安全。他们使用新疆奴工制造并推销其不道德的太阳能板；他们在刚果使用童工开采矿产资源钴；他们通过削弱我们的电力系统破坏我们的安全，同时自己大力使用煤炭能源。我们想过来表达对新中国联邦的支持。
