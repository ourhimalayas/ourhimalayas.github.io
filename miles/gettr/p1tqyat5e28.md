2022.10.10 The U.S. midterm elections are critical to the future direction of humanity and the United States. The four sanctions legislation against the Chinese Communist Party involve the protection of Hong Kong and Taiwan, sanctions against the Chinese Communist chip industry, and the investigation and sanctions of the overseas assets of Chinese Communist Party officials. These sanctions are tougher and more thorough those on Russia.
