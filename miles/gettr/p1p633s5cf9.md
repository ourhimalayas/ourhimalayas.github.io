8/31/2022 Miles Guo: Zeng Qinghong, Wang Qishan, and Meng Jianzhu are conspiring to strike Xi Jinping with a fatal blow, but they have no guts to do so. Fellow fighters, you'd better not expect that the fight between them will help us take down the CCP. Currently, Xi's investigation of many cases points to the families of Wang Qishan, Zeng Qinghong, and Jiang Zemin. Dai Yongge returned to Hong Kong not long ago, but he fled because Xi wanted to arrest him. Dai Yongge may not be able to return to Communist China due to several murder cases. Dai will either be repatriated to Communist China or have Xi eliminated.

8/31/2022 文贵直播：曾、王和孟想憋大招儿灭习却没胆量这么做，战友们别指望他们的斗争能帮咱灭共；现在习对很多案子的调查都指向了王家、曾家和江家；戴永革不久前回了香港，但他因习要抓他而逃离；他因几个命案而永远无法回国，他要么被遣返，要么得把习干掉
