2022.10.16  You heard it first from Miles Guo that Hong Kong stocks can't recover if they fall below the 20,000-point (support) level. As the U.S. CHIPS Act comes into effect, Hong Kong risks the toughest sanctions if it continues to side with the Chinese Communist Party and fabricates data. Several international airlines are preparing to cancel flight routes to Hong Kong because almost all routes to China are now losing money. More than half of the Hong Kong stocks are CCP state-owned enterprises. Once they are sanctioned across the board by the U.S., the consequences and details are beyond what Milles can reveal for the time being.
（无LOGO版）港股跌破2万点关卡就回不去了。随着美国芯片法禁令启动，香港若继续站队共产党，作假数据，香港将面临最严厉制裁。多家国际航空公司准备取消飞香港的航线。港股的经济当中有超过一半是共产党国有企业，这些企业一旦被美国全面制裁的话…七哥说有些话要搂住。
