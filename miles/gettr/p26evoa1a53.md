1/26/2023 Miles Guo’s GETTR: In a compound in Communist China, the corpses of those who died from the virus were often quietly taken out and buried at night, and the children of those who died said they wouldn’t want to make troubles for the CCP or their employers. Kim Jong-un recently cursed Xi and the CCP, who failed to earn any respect for the Chinese even after giving away tons of grains. But I offered wonderful advice to help African friends get money from the CCP. The New Federal State of China must start a revolution that will innovate technologies and eliminate the CCP at the same time.
