8/25/2022  Miles Guo's GETTR: My broadcast yesterday went viral in mainland China, but people are only interested in learning about the affairs of celebrities like Song Zuying and Yang Lan, and the CCP high-ranking cadres, nobody cares about Lao Baixing’s sufferings; No matter where you are, everybody will face a severe shortage of food and water, as well as the oppression and control by governments. Therefore, our fellow fighters should cherish and protect each other in order to get through the darkest time in human history hand in hand.

8/25/2022 文贵盖特：昨天的直播在国内反响极大，大家都对宋祖英和杨澜这些明星以及中共高官的事情感兴趣，但有多少人关心老百姓的死活？无论大家身处何地，都会面临缺粮、缺水和政府高压管制，所以战友们要互相珍惜和保护，一起度过人类最困难的时刻
