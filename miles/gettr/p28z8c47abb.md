2/19/2023 Miles Guo: The use of second-tier actors in the Chinese TV series The Knockout is to highlight Xi Jinping's “great experience” of being a deputy for decades so that he could rise to power, after which he overwhelmed the US with the spy balloon incident. The TV series exposes some dark sides of the society in order to help the CCP survive by slightly criticizing the minor issues.
