8/12/2022 Miles Guo: After the 20th Party Congress, Xi will purge the entire CCP to retaliate for previous grievances and eliminate his opponents. Zeng Wei doesn't believe the CCP will have his son and daughter sent back to Communist China. The struggle among Xi, Wang Qishan, Meng Jianzhu, and Zeng Qinghong is the last step before the CCP is dragged into the Thucydides Trap. It is a rumor that Hu Jintao, Zhu Rongji, and Jiang Zemin wrote a letter to go against Xi. The CCP's chip industry is involved in hundreds of billions of dollars of corruption. A crisis may break out in the East China Sea, and Shanghai may be shut down again.
