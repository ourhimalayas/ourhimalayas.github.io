2022.11.14  Zhao Changpeng, together with the Chinese Communist Party, ensnared FTX with its adversities. The Chinese Communist Party is cooking up digital currency phobia.  They want to vilify digital currencies before attaining the monopoly of the sector thus their status as the global leader. This is what the Chinese Communist Party is plotting before the Cryptocurrency Act 2020 becomes law by June next year.  
（无LOGO版）赵长鹏跟共产党一起，利用FTX缺陷，给他下套。共产党现在搞的叫数字货币恐惧，他们要丑化数字货币，然后垄断数字货币，达到让共产党在全球数字化货币领先的地位。这就是明年六月份数字货币法出来以前，共产党要干的事儿。
