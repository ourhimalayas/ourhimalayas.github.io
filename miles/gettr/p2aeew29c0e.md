【NFSC @CPAC 】03/02/2023 Enemy Within writer Trevor Loudon:  We have to treat it as organized crime. And we have to decouple the United States and Western countries completely 100% from the Chinese economy. And we have to get rid of the traitors in our own system who have been co-opted by CCP money. If they come forward and tell their story, they will not get prosecuted. Otherwise, they will be put into jail for 30 years. 

【新中国联邦DC星火行动】03/02/2023 《内部的敌人》作者特雷弗·劳登： 我们要把中共看作是犯罪组织。我们和西方国家需要百分之百同中共国经济脱钩。我们还需要将我们系统内部被中共收买的叛徒清理出去，如果他们站出来坦白罪行，那么将不会被起诉，否则就要面临30年刑期。
