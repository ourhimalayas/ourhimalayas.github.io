【AMFEST 2022】12/19/2022 A young American citizen Joey: Ultimately, everything that's going on in our country and in our society, comes down to the Chinese Communist Party. Their quest for power links very much to our societal demise. They're scared of what our citizens aspire to, and what our citizens live like, because if the people of China get to see that, they get to understand that, they will rise up.

【凤凰城涅槃行动】12/19/2022  一位美国年轻人乔伊：我们国家和社会现在存在的一切问题归根结底都源自中国共产党。中共这帮人对权力的追求关系到我们社会的存亡。他们害怕美国公民所向往的东西，以及我们生活的样子。因为中国人民会看到这一切，他们明白过来就会站起来反抗。
