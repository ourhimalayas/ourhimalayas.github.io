2022.12.02 There are a few issues Xi cannot resolve. First, the standoff between Xi and the West. Second, with all the issues that are about to erupt, the CCP can only hold on for ten months at most. It will speed up their invasion of Taiwan. With challenges from within and overseas, Xi regime could end instantly. China will have a chance to welcome true democracy.
有几大问题是习近平是绝对解决不了的，第一个是习家党目前与美国欧洲已经形成了事实上的对立。第二个是中国国内所有将爆发的问题，共产党最多也就撑十来个月，各种问题将促使习近平更快打台湾。中国目前面临的种种内忧外患，习家党将可能瞬间结束，中国将有机会迎来真正的民主。
