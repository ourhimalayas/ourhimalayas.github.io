2022.09.21 After the exposure of Putin’s illness, many countries believed that it was true. As to the nationwide military mobilization and his recent meeting with Xi, it’s all in his plan. As long as Putin lives, he might officially declare a war with Ukraine and might launch a nuclear war.
（无LOGO版）在爆出了普京的病情之后，许多国家都相信是这是真的。关于他最近的全国军事总动员和于习会面，早在他计划之中。只要普京活着，他可能会对乌克兰正式宣战并可能发动核战。
