2022.08.29 Miles Guo: Vaccine is a top priority. Everything else becomes insignificant. The vaccine changes everything. Having wealth doesn’t mean you have wisdom and having right doesn't mean you have wisdom. The ignorance may cost you everything. But you don't know how to be grateful. You may lose everything. We need to know these things are brought to you by the New Federal State of China and our fellow fighters.
