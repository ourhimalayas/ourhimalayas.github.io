2022.10.16 The Presidium of the Communist Party was mainly manipulated by Mao Zedong. To control the residium means to control everything. All the 3,000-people or 2600-people National People’s Congress are arranged by the Presidium, including the meeting agendas, including the motions to be raised, including who asks which topic, as well as what is on TV, and what is not, what is open to the public and what is not.
（无LOGO版）共产党的主席团，主要是也是毛泽东玩的。控制住主席团就控制了一切，所未来开的3,000人大会，2,600人大会都被主席团安排，包括会议议程，包括提出的问题，包括你谁来问什么样的话题，上电视，不上电视，什么叫对外公开，什么叫不公开。
