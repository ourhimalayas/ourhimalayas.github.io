03/02/2023 Nicole: CCP has already weaponized the US government agencies. If you look into those more that 70 lawsuits which CCP brought against Mr. Miles Guo, you will be able to find out how CCP has weaponized the US government agencies and be amazed by how deeply the CCP has infiltrated into this country. The US has been condoning and appeasing the CCP for several decades, and even US Federal Government has been funding the CCP to conduct crimes against humanity, including destroying America.

03/02/2023 妮可：中共已将美国政府机构武器化了。如果人们调查中共对郭文贵先生提起的70多起诉讼，就能发现中共是如何将美国政府机构武器化的，并对中共对美国的渗透深度感到震惊。美国数十年来一直在姑息和纵容中共，美国联邦政府甚至一直在资助中共进行反人类的罪行，其中就包括摧毁美国。
