2022.09.12 【Nicole看七哥】于新中国联邦人而言，不是钱，而是灭共让我们走在一起。因此，我们都应该懂得让步既是一种修养，也是一种美德。谦让是福报，约有涵养的人越需要懂得让步。

For the people of the New Federal State of China, it's the willingness to take down the CCP that band us together, but not the money. Therefore, we should understand that giving in is a kind of cultivation and virtue. Humility is a blessing. The more well-cultivated people are, the more they know how to give in.
