11/29/2022 SAY NO TO EVIL DAY 10: While protesting at Paul Hastings' New York headquarter, the fellow fighters of NFSC met a lawyer who is familiar with Paul Hastings. He did not expect that Paul Hastings’ lawyers worked for the CCP without being registered as foreign agents, which is illegal.

11/29/2022 对邪恶说不 第10天：战友们在普衡纽约总部抗议现场遇到了一位非常熟悉普衡的律师，他没有想到普衡的律师在没有注册为外国代理人的情形下为中国共产党服务，这是不合法的。
